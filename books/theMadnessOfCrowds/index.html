            <h1>Gay</h1>
            <p>The manner in which people and movements behave at the point of victory can be the most revealing thing about them. Do you allow arguments that worked for you to work for others? Are reciprocity and tolerance principles or fig-leaves? Do those who have been censored go on to censor others when the ability is in their own hands?</p>
            <p>In doing so they contradict the claims made by gay rights activists from the start of the battle for gay equality, which is that it should be no business of anyone else what consenting adults get up to in private. If that goes for the rights of gay groups then surely it ought to apply to the rights of Christian fundamentalists and other groups too.</p>
            <p>In <em>On Liberty</em>, first published in 1859, John Stuart Mill famously laid out four reasons for why free speech was a necessity in a free society: the first and second being that a contrary opinion may be true, or true in part, and therefore may require to be heard in order to correct your own erroneous views, the third and fourth being that even if the contrary opinion is in error, the airing of it may help to remind people of a truth and prevent its slippage into an ignorant dogma which may in time - if unchallenged - itself become lost.</p>
            <p>As Robert Samuels wrote in the <em>Washington Post</em>, 'Hillary Clinton had the chance to make gay rights history. She refused.' Yet in 2016 when she was campaigning for the Presidency for the second time and the views of wider society had shifted markedly, the LGBY community (as gays had now become) were one of the specific sections of the country whom Clinton claimed to be campaigning especially hard for. It is not unusual for politicians to shift positions. But the speed with which the times changed made for some remarkably sharp changes of positions in the political class.</p>
            <p>Yesterday there was one dogma. Now there is another.</p>
            <p>But the moral factor that has most clearly shifted attitudes towards homosexuality has been a shift from the idea that homosexuality is a learned behaviour to a belief that it is innate. A recognition of how important this was in the case of gays has significant implications for every other rights campaign. For here we can glimpse one of the most significant building blocks of contemporary morality: the fundamental recognition that it is wrong to punish, demean or look down on people for characteristics over which they have no control. This may seem like an obvious building block of morality, but it was not there for much of human history, when people's unalterable characteristics were very often used against them.</p>
            <p>The single factor that has most clearly helped to change public opinion about homosexuality in the West has been the decision that homosexuality is in fact a 'hardware' rather than a 'software' issue.</p>
            <p>What child would want to be more of a target for bullies by being gay? What developing adult would want to add an extra layer of complexity to an already complex life?</p>
            <p>So the zeitgeist appears to have settled on the 'Born this way' theory, while avoiding any glances at the destabilizing fact that the science is still not very much use in helping to back up Lady Gaga's theory.</p>
            <p>LGBT is now one of the goupings which mainstream politicians routinely speak about - and to - as if they actually exist like a racial or religious community. It is a form of absurdity. For even on its own terms this composition is wildly unsustainable and contradictory. Gay men and gay women have almost nothing in common. It may be too pedestrian to even mention, but gay men and lesbians do not always form the warmest of relationships. Gay men often characterize lesbians as dowdy and boring. Lesbians often characterize gay men as silly and displaying a failure to grow up. Neither have very much use for each other, and almost none meet in any 'communal' spaces. There are places where gay men can hook up and places where gay women can hook up, but there have hardly been any places in the decades since gay liberation where gay men and women organize or assemble to be near each other on anything like a regular basis.</p>
            <p>But it is worth bearing these internal frictions and contradictions in mind when people talk about the LGBT community, or try to co-opt it for any political purpose. It barely exists even within each letter of its constituent parts. And each has little in common with the others.</p>
            <p>From the origins of gay activism to the present every imaginable tension still exists over what is being asked for. It comes down to the unresolved question of whether gays are exactly like everybody else other than in one single characteristic. Or whether that single characteristic makes gays utterly unlike the rest of society. It is a divide which falls into two broad camps.</p>
            <p>In the first are those who believe that gays are - and should be - just like everybody else. That they will win any and all remaining rights battles by demonstrating that nothing makes them different from their heterosexual friends and neighbours.</p>
            <p>But such works, preaching a path to acceptance to gays via normalization with the rest of society, always found themselves countered by another element within precisely the same alleged 'community'.</p>
            <p>This side might be described (and self-described) not as 'gay' but as 'queer'. It was - and is - the group of people who believe that being attracted to the same sex means more than simply being attracted to the same sex. It is a group of people who believe that being attracted to the same sex should merely be the first stage in a wilder journey. The first step not just to getting on with life but to transgressing the normal modes of life. Whereas gays may just want to be accepted like everyone else, queers want to be recognized as fundamentally different to everyone else and to use that difference to tear down the kind of order that gays are working to get into. It is an almost never acknowledged but completely central divide that has existed as long as 'gay' has been recognized as an identity.</p>
            <p>But the radical attitude persisted. And the divide between the gays who wanted equality and those who wanted to use being gay merely as a first step to tearing down some other order or forming some new sort of society persisted. It was rarely more openly displayed than in the 'March on Washington' on 25 April 1993. This march had been intended to do for gay rights what Martin Luther King's march had done for the civil rights movement of three decades earlier. But the 1993 march was a mess, including 'obscene comics' and 'fire-breathing radicals who spoke for only a tiny segment of the gay population'. It was, as Bawer said, 'as if the march's organisers were out to confirm every last stereotype about homosexuals'...</p>
            <p>There is nothing wrong with people enjoying whatever kinks they like in the privacy of their homes. But you don't have to be prudish to feel that the phalanxes of people at such protests dressed in fetish gear, in chaps and more, is off-putting to whatever cause they are hoping to advance. If the black civil rights movement had included a fetish section it would have been considerably easier to ignore its moral force.</p>
            <p>But the gays will not be corralled. Not by themselves and certainly not by others. Those calling for equality will always include a contingent who mistake exhibitionism for activism, feeling that nobody is free or equal until they have the right to dress in puppy gear and be led on all fours by a 'master' down a public street.</p>
            <p>Amid all the talk of 'equality' there isn't anything like certainty that most gays actually want to be completely equal. Many would appear to want to be precisely equal but with a little gay bonus.</p>
            <p>At the start of the 'MeToo' scandal in 2017, any man who had not just ever inappropriately touched, but anyone who had ever objectified, a woman was in touble. But it seemed that DeGeneres did not have to play by the same rules.</p>
            <p>It's not such an uncommon claim. In 2010 the BBC broadcast a short film by the Reverend Sharon Ferguson (who was also CEO of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement) in which she claimed that lesbians like her weren't just as good at being parents as heterosexual couples. According to her, lesbians actually make better parents than heterosexual couples do. Similar claims, based on equally dubious statistics that always sound more like propaganda than analysis, crop up with considerable regularity.</p>
            <p>Although Thiel had said that he didn't agree with 'every plank in our party's platform', he did state that 'fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline'. As he went on, 'When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?'</p>
            <p>In fact the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016 had been carried out by a young Muslim who swore allegiance to Islamic State (ISIS). Yet this detail didn't detain <em>Advocate</em> or the Gay Pride march in New York later the same month. On that occasion the parade led with a huge rainbow banner emblazoned with the words 'Republican Hate Kills!', clearly forgetting that Omar Mateen had not been a member of the Republican Party.</p>

            <h2>Interlude</h2>
            <h1>The Marxist Foundations</h1>
            <p>Today a version of this old image has made its way to the centre of the social justice ideology. Just one of the things that suggest the Marxist foundations of this new structure is the fact that capitalism is still at the top of the pyramid of oppression and exploitation. But the other top tiers of this hierarchy pyramid are inhabited by different types of people. At the top of the hierarchy are people who are white, male and heterosexual. They do not need to be rich, but matters are made worse if they are. Beneath these tyrannical male overlords are all the minorities: most noticeably the gays, anyone who isn't white, people who are women and also people who are trans. These individuals are kept down, oppressed, sidelined and otherwise made insignificant by the white, patriarchal, heterosexual, 'cis' system. Just as Marxism was meant to free the labourer and share the wealth around, so in this new version of an old claim, the power of the patriarchal white males must be taken away and shared around more fairly with the relevant minority groups.</p>
            <p>No one academic involved in the pushing of identity politics and intersectionality has come from the conservative right. And there are several reasons why that isn't a surprise. One is the ideological bent that exists within academia. One 2006 study of universities in the US found that 18 per cent of professors in the social sciences happily identified as 'Marxist.' And though there are other departments that have relatively few Marxists in them, any field in which a fifth of all professors were shown to believe in a wildly controversial (to say the least) dogma might raise questions. The same survey found 21 per cent of social science professors willing to identify as 'activist' and 24 per cent as radical. This is considerably higher than the number of professors willing to identify as 'Republican' in any field.</p>
            <p>Even when it does not identify itself as such, the Marxist and post-Marxist trend on the political left can always be recognized by the set of thinkers whom it cites and reveres, and whose theories it tries to apply to any and all disciplines and walks of life.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless for a certain type of person who is intent on finding blame rather than forgiveness in the world,Foucault helps to explain everything. And what Foucault and his admirers seek to explain in personal relations they also attempt to explain on a grand political level. For them absolutely everything in life is a political choice and a political act.</p>
            <p>To 'deconstruct' something is as significant in academia as 'constructing' things is in the rest of society. Indee, it is one curiosity of academia in recent decades that is has found almost nothing it does not wish to deconstruct, apart from itself.</p>
            <p>The first priority of this segment of academia over recent decades - the first thing to 'unweave' - was to assail, undermine and finally pull down everything that had previously appeared to be fixed certainties, including biological certainties.</p>
            <p>It was only after this 'unweaving' had been performed that a new weaving began to take place. This is where the foundational texts of social justice and intersectionality stepped in. Having cleared the space, they then turned out to have cleared it for ideas of their own.</p>
            <p>In them McIntosh lists fifty things which she claims to see as the 'daily effects of white privilege.' They include claims such as 'I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time' and 'I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty sell assured that I will not be followed or harassed.' Many of the claims which McIntosh makes in 1988 already seem absurd and dated today. Most are not applicable only to white people and none proves anything like the systemic point that McIntosh would appear to be making.</p>
            <p>It should be said that this is not some obscure work but one that is regularly cited. Indeed, Google Scholar shows it to have been cited more than 16,000 times. In <em>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy</em> as well as other works, including <em>Socialist Strategy: Where Next?</em>, Laclau and Mouffe are perfectly frank about what they think could be achieved and how.</p>
            <p>Although Laclau and Mouffe are distinctly vague about a whole array of conclustions, one thing they are clear about is the utility for the socialist struggle of 'new social movements' such as the women's movement.</p>
            <p>The utility of such groups is obvious: their 'highly diverse struggles: urban, ecological, anti-authoritarian, anti-institutional, feminist, anti-racist, ethnic, regional or that of sexual minorities' give purpose and drive to a socialist movement that needs new energy. What is more, unless they cohere together these groups might just pursue their own agendas and their own needs. What is needed is to bring all these movements under one umbrella: the umbrella of the socialist struggle.</p>
            <p>In the <em>Marxism Today</em> article that Laclau and Mouffe wrote in the run-up to their book they were even clearer about the utility of these movements. Because although they may be opposed to the same thing that socialists are opposed to, these 'new political subjects' ('women, students, young people, racial, sexual and regional minorities, as well as the various anti-institutional and ecological struggles') have an obvious immediate advantage. The primary one is that:</p>
            <p class="subPara">Their enemy is defined not by its function of exploitation, but by wielding a certain power. And this power, too, does not derive from a place in the relations of production, but is the outcome of the form of social organisation characteristic of the present society. This society is indeed capitalist, but this is not its only characteristic; it is sexist and patriarchal as well, not to mention racist.</p>
            <p>One of the traits of Marxist thinkers has always been that they do not stumble or self-question in the face of contradiction, as anybody aiming at truth might. Marxists have always rushed towards contradiction. The Hegelian dialectic only advances by means of contradiction and therefore all the complexities - one might say absurdities - met along the way are welcomed and almost embraced as though they were helpful, rather than troubling, to the cause. Anybody hoping that intersectionality would dissolve amid its own inherent contradictions cannot have seen the myriad of contradictions a Marxist can hold in their head at any one time.</p>
            <p>Their idiological children in identity politics and intersectionality seem content to inhabit an ideological space littered with contradiction, absurdity and hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>By contrast, anybody who got in the way of this direction of travel found themselves mown down with astonishing vigour. The weapons to hand (accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia and finally transphobia) were all too easy to wield and there was no price to pay for wielding them unfairly, unjustifiably or indeed frivolously. Critics of the emerging orthodoxy, including scientists, were accused of being propelled by the most base motives. As Steven Pinker wrote in 2002, 'Many writers are so desperate to discredit any suggestion of an innate human constitution that they have thrown logic and civility out the window...The analysis of ideas is commonly replaced by political smears and personal attacks...The denial of human nature has spread beyond the academy and has led to a disconnect between intellectual life and common sense.'</p>
            <p>Of course it had. For the purpose of large sections of academia had ceased to be the exploration, discovery or dissemination of truth. The purpose had instead become the creation, nurture and propagandization of a particular, and peculiar, brand of politics. The purpose was not academia, but activism.</p>
            <p>Another curiosity about the intersectional movement is the camouflage that it employs. For aside from McIntosh's most popular document, the one thing that all the purveyors of the ideologies of social justice and intersectionality have in common is that their work is unreadable. Tehir writing has the deliberately obstructive style ordinarily employed when someone either has nothing to say or needs to conceal the fact that what they are saying is not true. Here is one sentence from Judith Butler in full flow:</p>
            <p class="subPara">The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural tonalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.</p>
            <p>Prose this bad can only occur when the author is trying to hide something.</p>
            <p>Still, the purveyors of social justice theories have done a job, in providing a library of works which (however unreadable) present an intellectual framework on top of which poliltical positions can be adopted and politicized claims can be made. Anyone who finds it useful to argue that gender or race are social constructs can cite a whole library of material to bolster their claim and cite endless numbers of tenured academics who can 'prove' it.</p>
            <p>Any student wondering whether the world really works like this can be instantly presented with the library of intimidating evidence that the gobbledygook he is failing to comprehend is his fault and not the fault of the writer of the gobbledygook.</p>
            <p>Of course sometimes when it is nearly impossible to tell what is being said, almost anything can be said and exceptionally dishonest arguments can be smuggled in under the guise of complexity.</p>
            <p>The spoofs carried out by Boghossian and his colleagues made a number of deadly serious points. Not just that these areas of academic study had become playgrounds for frauds, but that there was absolutely nothing that could not be said, studied or claimed so long as it fitted into the pre-existing theories and presumptions of the relevant fields and utilized its disastrous language. So long as people were willing to claim that we live in a patriarchal society, a 'rape-culture,' a homophobic, transphobic and racist culture; so long as they indict their own society and scatter in a smattering of admiration for any other society (from an approved list), then almost anything can be said. So long as the pyramid of oppression is believed in and propagated to others, almost anything can find its way into the canon of unreadable and largely uncited academic work.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>2</h2>
            <h1>Women</h1>
            <p>The facts are certainly on Pinker's side, but the noisier voices are not. As a result, since Pinker wrote <em>The Blank Slate</em> our societies have doubled-down on the delusion that biological difference - including aptitude differences - can be pushed away, denied or ignored.</p>
            <p>The fall-out of this and much else is toxic. Most people are not gay. Men and women have to find some ways of getting along. And yet the societal self-delusion over biological reality is just one in a whole series of such self-delusions that our societies have decided to engage in.</p>
            <p>Of all the things that are deranging our societies, everything to do with the sexes - and particularly relations between the sexes - are perhaps the most deranging of all. Because the facts are there all the time, in front of our eyes. It is just that we are not meant to notice them, or if we notice them we are expected to stay silent.</p>
            <p>In 2016 exposing your breasts was a 'feminist' act. Exposing them to a man who had not asked to see them was an especially 'feminist' act. And even a woman who claimed for religious and social reasons to be 'modest' could willingly and easily delight a studio audience by flashing her breasts - unasked for - at a man.</p>
            <p>After all, the response to this interview reached fever pitch even when compared to the standard response to a Peterson interview. Online chat forums were filled with people claiming that he had said that women who wear makeup and high heels at work are asking to be sexually assaulted. Parts of the media followed suit. And moments like this are interesting. Because if somebody says that opening this discussion up does not mean women shouldn't dress how they like, and yet still a lot of people hear (or claim to hear) that this is exactly what Peterson is saying, and what's more that he is excusing sexual assault, then something is clearly going badly wrong. This is not about mishearings or misunderstandings. It is more likely an example of people deliberately and lazily adopting simplified misrepresentations of what other people are saying in order to avoid the difficult discussion that would otherwise have to take place.</p>
            <p>If a culture lands on the idea that women must always be believed in cases not just of sexual assault but of unwanted sexual advances, then this must generate some confusion in society. What are people to think about, and how should they react to, those occasions when they have experienced women doing that female thing? How are they to reconcile the information that women must always be believed with the fact that there are entire industries set up to help women fool men? Or - to put the most positive spin on it - to entice them. After all, what are all those summer advertising campaigns about that invite women to 'turn heads this summer'? Whose heads are they being invited to turn? Any and all passing women, hoping to purchase, say, the same dress or bikini? Or men?</p>
            <p>All this suggests our societies have arrived at a stage of seemingly industrial-strength denial. We have decided to forget or completely edit out things that were recognized to be valid the day before yesterday.</p>
            <p>The demand is that a woman must be able to lap-dance before, drape herself around and wiggle her ass in the face of any man she likes. She can make him drool. But if that man puts even one hand on the woman then she can change the game completely. She can go from stripper to mother superior in a heartbeat. She can go from 'Look at my butt, waving in front of your face' to 'How dare you think you can touch the butt I've been waving in front of your face all this time.' And it is he who must learn that he is in the wrong. What is the demand that is being made here? The impossible demand that cannot be met but which has been written into contemporary mores? It is that a woman must be allowed to be as sexy and sexual as she pleases, but that does not mean she can be sexualized. Sexy, but not sexualized.</p>
            <p>It is an impossible demand. And not just an unreasonable but a deranging demand to make on men. But nobody wants to explore it. Because to explore it would be to uncover a whole world of unremediable, unsolvable, complexity.</p>
            <p>The belief that it is possible to be sexy without being sexualized is just one of the contradictory settlements that we have landed on. But there are plenty of others in the air. For instance, there is the one that simultaneously insists that women are in every meaningful way exactly the same as men, possessing the same traits and competencies and able to challenge them on the same turf at any time. Yet simultaneously, magically, they are better than men. Or better in specific ways. All this seems perfectly capable of being held in the same head - contradictory though it all is. So that the current accepted way of regarding women is: the same as men, but different where it's useful or flattering.</p>
            <p>Women are exactly the same as men - as capable, as able, as suited to the same array of tasks. And also better. Exactly how this is the case is ill defined because it is ill thought through. Nevertheless we have decided to embed precisely such ill-thinking as deep into our societies as we can possibly manage.</p>
            <p>Not least among the oddities of this discussion whenever it arises - and this is very common today - is the fact that privilege is an unbelievably hard thing to define. It is also very nearly impossible to quantify. One person may have 'privilege' from inheriting money. For another person this same privilege may be a curse, giving them too much too early and disincentivizing them from making their way in the world. Is a person with inherited wealth but who has a natural disability more privileged or less privileged than a person without any inherited wealth who is able-bodied? Who can work this out? Who would we trust to work it out? And how can the various stratas of this arrangement be flexible enough not just to include everybody in view but also take into account the comparative changes for the better and worse which will occur across every human life?</p>
            <p>In Britain the <em>Telegraph</em> is regarded as the newspaper of the conservative right. Its readers might fairly be said to be less in favour of change than in things broadly staying the same, whereas unconscious bias training must be very high up the list of things that will stop anything being the same. That is the point of it. It is intended to change everything.</p>
            <p>The schemes themselves slightly differ, but all centre around versions of what at Harvard University has been developed as the Implicit Association Test (IAT).</p>
            <p>What the IAT attempts to work out is who individuals think of as being in an 'in group' and who they might see as being in an 'out group.' Cited thousands of times in academic papers, it has undoubtedly become the most influential measure of 'unconscious bias.'</p>
            <p>When people talk about 'questioning' things through the application of unconscious bias training they do not seem to mean 'questioning' people. They mean 'changing' them.</p>
            <p>It isn't just how people look, how they are dressed or what firmness their handshake does or does not have. It is about a whole set of other signals and impressions that a person gives off. And the response to them does indeed involve prejudice, and swift decision-making. Not all of which will be bad.</p>
            <p>For example, most people have a natural prejudice against those with swiftly moving, shifting or darting eyes. Is that presumption a 'bias' or might it be justified, built in by an evolutionary instinct that it may be unwise to overcome?</p>
            <p>Since its deployment in the corporate world, government, academia and an increasing number of other places, two out of the three people who created the IAT at Harvard have publicly admitted that the test cannot do what it purports to do with sufficient accuracy. One of the three, Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia, has said publicly that the extent to which the test can measure anything meaningful has been misconceived.</p>
            <p>So here is a whole area which has been insufficiently studied but has already been rolled out across government and business. Will its effects be benign, its only costs being the huge expense in recruiting experts to guide people in this inexpert discipline? Or will attempts to presume to rewire the brains of every single government employee and everybody in business have repercussions which nobody has yet dared to imagine? Who knows.</p>
            <p>To say that intersectionality has not been thoughtthrough is an understatement. Together with its other faults it has not been put to the test in any meaningful way anywhere for any meaningful length of time. It has the most tenuous basis in philosophy and has no major work of thought dedicated to it. To which someone might respond that there are plenty of things that haven't been tried yet and that don't have a fully worked-out structure of thought behind them. But in such cases it would ordinarily be deemed presumptuous, not to say unwise, to try to roll out that concept across an entire society, including every educational institution and every profitable place of business.</p>
            <p>For instance, every firm that makes a concerted effort to promote people of colour, women or sexual minorities will always arrive at a moment where they make some version of the following discovery: the people they have promoted are themselves likely to be comparatively privileged. In many, though not all, cases they are people who have already been well served by the system. They may be women who are from a well-off background, who have been privately educated and gone to the best universities. Did they require a leg-up? Possibly. But at whose expense?</p>
            <p>For people in such companies are gradually realizing that there are costs to all this. That is, while their companies have managed to increase female mobility and ethnic minority mobility, their level of class mobility has never been lower. All they have managed to do is build a new hierarchy.</p>
            <p>The wave of feminism which began in the 1960s addressed the priorities that remained unresolved underneath those basic rights. Issues such as the rights of women to pursue their desired careers and to be supported in those aims.</p>
            <p>These feminists argued for reproductive rights around contraception and abortion, for the safety of women inside marriages as well as out of them. The aim of these feminists was to help get women to the place where they would have an equal shot in their lives and careers, comparable to men.</p>
            <p>Having managed between two and three waves (depending where and how you are counting) in as many centuries, by the 1980s the feminist movement splintered and fell out over niche issues such as what attitudes feminists should take towards pornography. Those people often described as third-wave feminists emerged, like the fourth-wavers that swiftly followed them in the 2010s, with a striking style of rhetoric. With the major battles for equality behind them, it might have been expected that feminists would mop up the remaining issues that existed and that the fact that things had never been better would mean that the pitch of their rhetoric matched this reality.</p>
            <p>Ignoring a fair amount of evidence to the contrary, and showing no compunction about essentializing or making generalizations about the male half of the species, French declares that 'the only ground of male solidarity is opposition to women.' She sees the demands of feminists as equally straightforward. The challenge to 'patriarchy' by feminists is simply a demand 'to be treated as human being with rights,' including the deamand 'that men not fee free to beat, rape, mutilate, and kill them.' What kind of monster would oppose that? And who are the members of this patriarchy who feel free to beat, rape, mutilate and kill women?</p>
            <p>Gradually the most extreme claims took over as the norm. Not just the most extreme claims about men, but the most extreme claims about women as well.</p>
            <p>Exaggeration and catastrophism became the regular currency in which feminists were encouraged to deal.</p>
            <p>As is so often the case, a member of the public was at hand to ask if Penny might perhaps have had father issues that caused her to use phrases such as these. At which point, as so often, Penny pivoted on a dime. 'Actually, my father was wonderful, and a great inspiration. He passed away a few years ago. We all miss him.' The reader pushed his point. 'Was he toxic?' he enquired. At which point the reader was reprimanded by Penny for being 'harsh.' She went on to reprimand him: 'It's not appropriate to make cracks about someone's dead dad.' Meaning the line had already developed to: 'All men are trash apart from my late father, who you're not allowed to mention.' Within an hour the victimhood narrative developed even further. Penny returned to Twitter to say: 'Right now I'm facing a barrage of abuse, threats, antisemitism, fantasies about my death, disgusting things said about my family. It has rapidly become frightening. This is all because I said "I like the phrase 'men are trash'", it implies the potential for change.' Which actually wasn't what she had said. She had said how delighted she was to use a phrase that described half of the human species as 'trash.' And then having behaved like a bully she found shelter behind the claim of being bullied. As though, having written off half the human race, it would be wrong to get any kind of pushback.</p>
            <p>In conclustion, when women say 'men are trash' what they in fact are saying is 'Your ideas of manhood are no longer fit for purpose and your lack of evolution is hurting us all.' It is saying that men are the slow kids in the class and that they have got, in El-Wardany's words, to 'get there a lot faster.'</p>
            <p>Nor is this campaign limited to Twitter hashtaggery. Over the last decade we have seen the entry into everyday public discussion of a range of slogans such as 'male privilege.' Like most slogans it is easy to spout but hard to put a finger on.</p>
            <p>Then there is the concept of 'the patriarchy' - the idea that people (largely in Western capitalist countries) live in a society which is rigged in favour of men and with the aim of suppressing women and their skills.</p>
            <p>In January the American Psychological Association released its first ever guidelines for how its members should specifically deal with men and boys. The APA claimed that 40 years of research showed that 'traditional masculinity - marked by stoicism, competitiveness, dominance and aggression, is undermining men's well-being.'</p>
            <p>The APA went on to define traditional masculinity as 'a particular constellation of standards that have held sway over large segments of the population, including: anti-femininity, achievement, eschewal of the appearance of weakness, and adventure, risk, and violence.' It was just one of the inroads that the concept of 'toxic masculinity' has made into the mainstream.</p>
            <p>If 'adventure' and 'risk' are indeed male traits then when and where should men be encouraged to drop them? Should a male explorer be encouraged to be less adventurous, a male firefighter be trained to take fewer risks? Ought male soldiers be encouraged to be less connected to 'violence' and be keener to show an appearance of weakness? If so when?</p>
            <p>The more obvious explanation from any outside analysis is that there seems to be a move less intended to improve men than to neuter them, to turn any and all of their virtues around on them and turn them instead into self-doubting, self-loathing objects of pity. It looks, in a word, like some type of revenge. <br>Why would that be? Why would the war and the rhetoric become so heated when the standards of equality have so much improved? Is it because the stakes are low? Because people are bored and want to assume the heroic posture amid a life of relative safety and comfort? Or is it simply that social media - the challenge of speaking to yourself or possibly to the entire planet - is making honest discussion impossible?</p>
            <p>Explaining why the vast majority of the public didn't identify with the feminist label, she said, 'The simple truth is that if you want a more equal society for women and men then you are in fact a feminist.' Yet when asked what words popped into respondents' heads first when they heard the word 'feminist,' the single most popular word that came to them - indeed to more than a quarter of respondents - was 'bitchy.'</p>
            <p><em>Newsweek</em> summed up the shocking findings in a headline, 'Men with muscles and money are more attractive to straight women and gay men - showing gender roles aren't progressing.' Indeed. 'Progress' will only be achieved when women find men attractive who they don't think are attractive. What could be unachievable in that?</p>

            <h1>The Impact of Tech</h1>
            <p>If we are already running in the wrong direction then tech helps us to run there exponentially faster.</p>
            <p>As the work of Jon Ronson and others on 'public shaming' has shown, the internet has allowed new forms of activism and bullying in the guise of social activism to become the tenor of the time. The urge to find people who can be accused of 'wrong-think' works because it rewards the bully. The social media companies encourage it because it is part of their business model. But rarely if ever do the people in the stampede try to work out why they are running in the direction they are.</p>
            <p>We have had to try to learn how to live in a world where at any moment we may be speaking to one other person or to millions around the world. The notion of private and public space has eroded.</p>
            <p>Difficult and contentious issues demand a great amount of thought. And a great amount of thought often necessitates trying things out (including making inevitable errors). Yet to think aloud on the issues which are most controversial has become such a high risk that on a simple risk/reward ratio there is almost no point in anyone taking it.</p>
            <p>Although a variety of thinkers have set a certain amount of weather, the ferocious winds of the present do not come from academic philosophy or social science departments. They emanate from social media. It is there that assumptions are embedded. It is there that attempts to weigh up facts can be repackaged as moral transgressions or even acts of violence.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is the cognitive dissonance this creates which makes the Valley wish to course-correct the world since it can't course-correct itself.</p>
            <p>In recent years the Valley has not just adopted the ideological presumptions of intersectionalists and social justice warriors. They have embedded them at a level so deep that this provides a whole new layer of madness in any society which imbibes them.</p>
            <p>However, on any number of searches what is revealed is not a 'fair' view of things, but a view which severely skews history and presents it with a bias from the present.</p>
            <p>The one overwhelming problem with this attitude is that it sacrifices truth in the pursuit of a political goal. Indeed, it decides that truth is part of the problem - a hurdle that must be got over. So where diversity and representation are found to have been inadequate in the past, this can be solved most easily by changing the past.</p>

            <h2>3</h2>
            <h1>Race</h1>
            <p>Although many people have attempted to live up to that hope and many have succeeded, in recent years an insidious current has developed that has chosen to reject Dr King's dream, and insist that content of character is nothing compared to the colour of someone's skin. It has decided that skin colour is everything.</p>
            <p>Yet the greatest backsliding on Dr King's dream has not come from there. It has come from people who almost certainly believe themselves to be pursuing the same path as that which Dr King outlined on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. In pursuit of anti-racism these people turn race from one of many important issues into something which is more important than anything else. At the very moment when the issue of race might at long last have been put to rest, they have decided once again to make it the most important issue of all.</p>
            <p>In her 2011 book <em>Being White, Being Good: White Complicity, White Moral Responsibility and Social Justice Pedagogy</em> (2011) Applebaum explains how even white people who are avowedly anti-racist may still be racist. It is just that they are often racist in ways that they have not yet realized.</p>
            <p>The aim of 'whiteness studies,' as Applebaum proudly states, is that it is 'committed to disrupting racism by problematizing whiteness.' This is to be done 'as a corrective.' So whereas every other field of race studies is performed in a spirit of celebration the aim of this one must be to 'problematize' hundreds and hundreds of millions of people.</p>
            <p>Of course it might be said that what will continue to ring even more true is that defining an entire group of people, their attitudes, pitfalls and moral associations, based solely on their racial characteristics is itself a fairly good demonstration of racism.</p>
            <p>As Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt have shown in their 2018 book <em>The Coddling of the American Mind</em>, catastrophizing has become one of the distinctive attitudes of the era. Just as women can be told that we live in a culture so rife with rape that it can fairly be described as a 'rape culture,' so too people behave as though they live in a society teetering on the edge of Hitlerism.</p>
            <p>In the same way, whereas there are places in the world where racism is rife and there are societies which could at some point teeter back into some kind of racial nightmare, one of the places least likely to switch into ethnic cleansing in the style of 1930s Germany must surely be a liberal arts college in a liberal state within North America. Strangely, it is at precisely such places that the most extreme claims are made, and the most extreme behaviour is found.</p>
            <p>But as he pointed out in a message sent on a campus email list:</p>
            <p class="subPara">There is a huge difference between a group or coalition deciding to voluntarily absent themselves from a shared space in order to highlight their vital and underappreciated roles (the theme of the Douglas Turner Ward play <em>Day of Absence</em>, as well as the recent Women's Day walkout), and a group encouraging another group to go away. The first is a forceful call to consciousness, which is, of course, crippling to the logic of oppression. The second is a show of force, and an act of oppression in and of itself.</p>
            <p>Weinstein said that he at any rate would not be forced to stay away from campus for the day. 'One's right to speak - or to be - must never be based on skin color.' That's what he thought.</p>
            <p>As a self-identifying progressive, left-winger and Bernie Sanders supporter, Bret Weinstein was not an obvious person on whom to affix accusations of racism. But they came anyway.</p>
            <p>There he tried to engage them in a civilized discussion, discuss the misunderstanding and reason with them.</p>
            <p>Weinstein tried to point out that there is a difference 'between debate and dialectic.' As he said, 'Debate means you are trying to win. Dialectic means you are using disagreement to discover what is true. I am not interested in debate. I am interested only in dialectic, which does mean I listen to you and you listen to me.'</p>
            <p>For people apparently worried about fascism these students proved startlingly good at organizing and behaving like stormtroopers.</p>
            <p>There is a whole dissertation to be written about what went on at Evergreen in those days, and about what students and others really thought was going on. All the characteristics of a modern campus outburst were there. The catastrophizing, the claims made which bore no resemblance to provable facts, the unleashing of entitlement in the guise of creating a level playing field, the turning of words into violence and violence into words.</p>
            <p>But events at Evergreen were not very unusual on an American campus. They were only an extension of a movement that had first come to wide public notice two years earlier at Yale University. Catastrophizing about racist incidents has become so common that it is unsurprising that students at Evergreen might have thought they could take it to the next level.</p>
            <p>The fact that students at Yale were able publicly to berate and curse at their professors, even getting them to act in exactly the way they wanted them to act - and eventually to hound them from their jobs - was significant. Perhaps this led to emboldening students at Evergreen and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>In a piece after the case had died down Christakis tried to explain what a university should be and that it was the duty of a university to 'cut at the root of a set of ideas that are wholly illiberal.' These included that 'Disagreement is not oppression. Argument is not assault. Words - even provocative or repugnant ones - are not violence. The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.'</p>
            <p>This is the idea - which has been swilling around in black politics and black radical thought for years - that since everything is set up by a structure of white hegemony every single thing in that structure is laced through with implicit or explicit racism, and that therefore every single aspect of it must be done away with. If any of the existing system is allowed to remain then racial justice cannot be arrived at.</p>
            <p>But it was the culmination of the students' peroration which was most revealing. There they wrote:</p>
            <p class="subPara">Historically, white supremacy has venerated the idea of objectivity, and wielded a dichotomy of 'subjectivity vs. objectivity' as a means of silencing oppressed peoples. The idea that there is a single truth - 'the Truth' - is a construct of Euro-West that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain. This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples.</p>
            <p>'The Truth' is a construct of the Euro-West. It is hard to think of a phrase which can at one and the same time be so wildly misguided and so dangerous in its implications.</p>
            <p>As people at safe liberal arts colleges in America have started to believe or pretend to believe that racism is ever-present where it is demonstrably absent, so in the wider world an obsession with race - and the ability to say racist things in pursuit of an alleged anti-racism - has become utterly normalized. And so, as Andrew Sullivan has noted, when surveying the craziness of campus and looking at the rest of society, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that 'We all live on campus now.'</p>
            <p>By 2018 it seemed as though whether you looked forward or backward, in tragedy or in comedy, always the same lens was looked through: the lens of race.</p>
            <p>Having watched a trailer of this children's cartoon, <em>Vice</em> felt licensed to report to its adult readership that Disney's remake of <em>Dumbo</em> appeared to be 'cute and heartwarming and seemingly neither racist nor terrifying.' What made them think that it would be? In what sort of world does a remake of a children's cartoon about a flying elephant have to be given such a health warning? The answer is - a world in which everything had become completely obsessed not by racial blindness but by racial obsession.</p>
            <p>Part of the madness of all this is that the desirable destination had been so nearly reached.</p>
            <p>But that was yesterday. Today, it has become wholly acceptable to suggest that the racial characteristics of an actor or performer are the most important characteristic when they are cast. More important, indeed, than their ability at performing the role. Race wars now break out on a regular basis in entertainment as everywhere else.</p>
            <p>And in the name of 'progress' and 'diversity' the most regressive and undiverse thing imaginable clocked up another victory.</p>
            <p>One obvious way to try to stop this digging down and down on race and racial characteristics would be to keep trying to blur the edges, for example by making those aspects of race which are able to be communicated and shared into an experience open to all. Aspects of a person's or a people's culture which others admire may for instance be shared so that a greater understanding can be found across any divides that do occur. That might be an ambition. But sadly a theory got there before that ambition could be fully realized. This one too started on campus and then split out into the real world. This concept was called 'cultural appropriation.'</p>
            <p>A benign reading of this could view it as imitation, and the sincerest form of flattery.</p>
            <p>Instead, the least benign reading possible came into play, which was that this cultural theft was the last insult of colonialism, and that having raped a country's natural resources and subjected its people to foreign rule the colonial powers could not even leave the subject peoples with their own culture unmolested or unseized.</p>
            <p>In 2017 there was the case of a couple who opened a food truck selling burritos. According to the new local rules, this couple were guilty of cultural appropriation - specifically of 'stealing' Mexican culture by selling burritos while not being Mexican. The owners of the food truck ended up receiving death threats and had to close all social media accounts and eventually their business. To say that victories like this embolden people is to understate matters. In the aftermath of the burrito van victory a list was compiled and circulated by local Oregon activists titled 'Alternatives to white-owned appropriative restaurants in Portland.' Suggestions of restaurants owned by 'people of colour' were given instead.</p>
            <p>This is an important cog in the crowd-maddening mechanism: the person who professes themselves most aggrieved gets the most attention. Anyone who is unbothered is ignored. In an age of shouting for attention on social media the mechanism rewards outrage over sanguinity.</p>
            <p>It suggests that you are only a member of a recognized minority group so long as you accept the specific grievances, political grievances and resulting electoral platforms that other people have worked out for you. Step outside of these lines and you are not a person with the same characteristics you had before but who happens to think differently from some prescribed norm. You have the characteristics taken away from you. So Thiel is no longer gay once he endorses Trump. And Kanye West is no longer black when he does the same thing. This suggests that 'black' isn't a skin colour, or a race - or at least not those things alone. It suggests that 'black' - like gay - is in fact a political ideology. This presumption goes so deep - and is so rarely mentioned - that it is generally simply assumed.</p>
            <p>All of which suggested that 'black' was not to do with skin colour, or race. But only politics. So much so that a Caucasian wearing bronzer but holding the 'right' opinions was more black than a black Supreme Court Justice if that black Supreme Court Justice happens to be a conservative.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to unscramble the different standards being applied simultaneously by the content of speech because speech itself has become unimportant. What matters above everything is the racial and other identity of the speaker. Their identity can either condemn them or get them off.</p>
            <p>As with debate within feminism, this is not to say that racial disparities and racist opinions do not exist - any more than it could be claimed that no womem are ever held back anywhere because of their gender. But it is a curiosity of the age that, after the situation appears at the very least to be better than it ever was, it is presented as though it has never been worse.</p>
            <p>So once again in pursuit of anti-racism the anti-racists resorted to racism.</p>
            <p>Of all the foundations on which to base a diverse and civilized society, human equality must be the most important of all. Equality is the stated objective of every Westren Government, the stated aim of all mainstream civic organizations and the aspiration of anybody wishing to find a place in a polite society. But beneath this aspiration, presumption or hope, lies one of the most painful and unexploded bombs of all - and one of the best reasons why we need to be treading far more carefully than we are doing in the era of Twitter hashtaggery. This is the question of what equality means and whether it even exists.</p>
            <p>Equality in the eyes of God is a core tenet of the Christian tradition. But it has translated in the era of secular humanism not into equality in the eyes of God but equality in the eyes of man. And here there is a problem, which is that many people realize, fear or intuit that people are not entirely equal. People are not equally beautiful, equally gifted, equally strong or equally sensible. They are certainly not equally wealthy. They are not even equally lovable. And while the political left talks constantly of the need for equality and even equity (arguing, as Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and others do, that equality of outcome is not just desirable but possible), the political right responds with a call for equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. In fact both claims are almost certainly impossible locally and nationally, let alone globally.</p>
            <p>These counter-claims have themselves been persuasively refuted, but after a quarter of a century it is perfectly clear that the <em>Bell Curve</em> controversy will never be fought on the basis of the facts. These are too uncomfortable to be allowed to ream freely in the intellectual air. And so the fall-back position for refusing to engage with the evidence on IQ differentials is to say that even if the facts are there, and even if they are very clear, it is morally suspicious to want to look into them and that they in any case present us with ethical and moral problems so vast and complex that there is nothing at all that can be done with them.</p>
            <p>To her audience in Boston she also explained how white people who see people as individuals rather than by their skin colour are in fact 'dangerous.' Meaning that it took only half a century for Martin Luther King's vision to be exactly inverted.</p>

            <h2>Interlude</h2>
            <h1>On Forgiveness</h1>
            <p>But these cases deserve some reflection. First because cases like Norton's and Jeong's invite the question: 'What is a fair representation of a person in the internet age?' What is a fair way to describe somebody? Norton, for instance, might henceforth be summed up as 'The racist, homophobic tech journalist fired by <em>The New York Times</em>.' She might think a fairer version of her life would be 'Writer and mother.' But then Jeong presumably does not think of herself as a racist either. So who gets to call it? If it is the mob then we are in trouble.</p>
            <p>The second thing that is important about stories like those of Norton, Jeong and others is the question that the internet age has still not begun to contend with: how, if ever, is our age able to forgive? Since everybody errs in the course of their life there must be - in any healthy person or society - some capacity to be forgiven. Part of forgiveness is the ability to forget. And yet the internet will never forget. Everything can always be summoned up afresh by new people. A future employer will always see Norton's use of the 'n' word and wonder, context aside, whether this is the sort of person they would really want to hire.</p>
            <p>Just as the onlly tool to protect against unpredictability is some ability to make and keep promises, so Arendt says only one tool exists to ameliorate the irreversibility of our actions. That is 'the faculty of forgiving.' These two things necessarily go together - the ability to bind together through promises and the ability to stay bound through forgiveness. Of the latter Arendt writes:</p>
            <p class="subPara">Without being forgiven, released from the consequences of what we have done, our capacity to act would, as it were, be confined to one single deed from which we could never recover; we would remain the victim of its consequences forever, not unlike the sorcerer's apprentice who lacked the magic formula to break the spell.</p>
            <p>This was a truth before the rise of the internet, but how much truer it has become since.</p>
            <p>In some manner with which we still haven't even begun to wrestle, we have created a world in which forgiveness has become almost impossible, in which the sins of the father can certainly be visited upon the son.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>4</h2>
            <h1>Trans</h1>
            <p>There is no other issue (let alone one affecting relatively few people) that has so swiftly reached the stage whereby whole pages of newspapers are devoted to its latest developments, and where there is a never-ending demand not just to change the language but to make up the science around it.</p>
            <p>Not only is some type of gender-ambiguity or gender-fluidity common across most cultures, it is hard to think of a cluture in the world that does not include - and allow for - some variety of gender-ambiguity. It is not an invention of late modernity.</p>
            <p>Intersex is the natural phenomenon known to the medical professions for centuries but necessarily obscure to everyone else. It is the fact that a small percentile of human beings are born either with ambiguous genitalia or turn out to have other biological attributes (for instance an unusually large clitoris, or an unusually small penis) which suggest that they may lie somewhere between the sexes.</p>
            <p>For instance, Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS) is the term for people born with male genitalia but who also turn out to have female reproductive organs such as fallopian tubes and even a uterus.</p>
            <p>Yet even today there is little understanding of how relatively common intersex is. It has been estimated that in America today around one in every two thousand children is born with sexual organs that are indeterminate, and around one in every three hundred will need to be referred to a specialist.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, through the advocacy of groups like ISNA a number of things have become clear. One is that intersex people exist and should not be held responsible for a situation over which they have absolutely no control. A considerable amount of sympathy and understanding can be felt for anybody who is born intersex.</p>
            <p>So the more visible that all these categories became - homosexuality, intersex, transvestitism, transsexualism - the more they became intertwined.</p>
            <p>Morris's memoir of that transition, <em>Conundrum (1974)</em>, remains one of the most persuasive and certainly the best-written accounts to date of why some people feel a need to transition across the sexes.</p>
            <p>It is perfectly easy to recognize that there are people who are born intersex. After reading the account of someone like Morris it is possible to understand there may be some people born as one sex who sincerely believe that they should be in the body of the other sex. What is exceptionally hard - and what we currently have few means of knowing - is how to navigate the leap beyond biology into testimony. Intersex is biologically provable. Trans may in the years to come turn out to be psychologically or biologically provable. But we don't even have much idea which field it might ever come under. And if this seems like a needlessly nit-picking way to look at what is some people's entire sense of 'identity,' then consider the difficulty of just one part of this delicate terrain.</p>
            <p>Autogynephilia is the arousal that comes from imagining yourself in the role of the opposite sex. But - nobody will be surprised to learn - there are divisions even within this 'community' and concerns and disputes over one type of autogynephilia versus another.</p>
            <p>One of the most striking trends as the trans debate has picked up in recent years is that autogynephilia has come to be severely out of favour. Or to put it another way, the suggestion that people who identify as trans are in actual fact merely going through the ultimate extreme of a sexual kink has become so hateful to many trans individuals that it is one of a number of things now decried as hate speech.</p>
            <p>According to one friend of Bailey's, he had been so 'terrorized' by the extreme response to his book that he almost became a different person after its publication. <br>All this happened simply because Bailey had performed detailed research to get to the root of a crucial question and come back with an answer that had just become unpopular. Because for the best part of this century so far the idea that trans is in any way about sexual enjoyment has become an outrage and sexualizing slur.</p>
            <p>The correct idea for people to currently hold is that trans people get absolutely no sexual thrill from the idea of being trans. They positively hate it. Nothing could be more boring.</p>
            <p>Although there has been some pushback in the work of Anne A. Lawrence (a self-declared autogynephilic) and others, the idea that transsexualism is any way propelled by autogynephilia has become a considerable source of aggravation to trans campaigners. The reason for this sharp U-turn is obvious. And it takes us back to the hardware-software issue. If people have a particular sexual kink then it may be due either to hardware or to software. But it is hard to persuade society that it should change nearly all of its social and linguistic norms in order to accommodate those sexual kinks. Society may tolerate you. It may wish you well. But your desire to dress in lady's knickers is no reason to force everyone to use entirely new pronouns. Or to alter every public bathroom. Or to bring up children with the belief that there is no difference between the sexes and that gender is a social construct.</p>
            <p>Autogynephilia risks presenting trans as a software issue. And that is the cause of the turn against it. For - as with homosexuals - there is a drive to prove that trans people are 'born this way.'</p>
            <p>The question becomes about whether what one person or even a lot of people believe to be true about themselves has to be accepted as true by other people or not.</p>
            <p>Trans campaigners intent on arguing that trans is hardware can only win their argument if they persuade people that being a woman is a matter of software. And not all feminists are willing to concede that one.</p>
            <p>'...Thinking what she thinks, she cannot be a prominent feminist any longer. She no longer stands for the same things we do.' Just as Peter Thiel was no longer gay and Kanye West no longer black, so Germaine Greer was no longer a feminist.</p>
            <p>Feminists like Bindel, Greer and Burchill come from the schools of feminism which remain concerned with matters of women's reproductive rights, the rights of women to escape violent and abusive relationships and much more. They are also women who believed in breaking down the stereotypes over what a woman should be or could be. Perhaps the most obvious point of non-overlap with the trans movement is that in many ways trans does not challenge social constructs about gender, but reinforces them.</p>
            <p>Despite the vilification that a particular generation of feminists has received for not getting on the trans train, it is never explained why they should. Their language may be colourful when they attack this target - as when they attack other targets - but the accusations of being hateful, dangerous, encouraging violence and even of not being feminists sidestep the legitimate questions they raise. Why should certain feminists feel entirely fine about men who become women only then to either flaunt their perfect breasts, ape the royal family or take up knitting?</p>
            <p>Of course trans campaigners like the group Mermaids suggest that the clustering and the increase in referrals is happening because some people are simply more aware of the possibility that they are trans than they would have been even a few years ago. But other explanations are at least equally possible. One is the way that trans is portrayed in popular culture - especially online. Another is the increasing number of concessions to any and all trans demands by figures in authority.</p>
            <p>Whenever Sarah's daughter described her feelings of gender dysphoria her mother noticed that the words seemed 'rather scripted.' And to say that the script was manipulative is an understatement.</p>
            <p>And at 15 she was told that she should start taking the puberty blocker Lupron. At each stage it was stressed that it was 'insulting' for the mother to question the feelings of her daughter and that as with trans people so with autistic people: 'Autistic people know who they are,' she was reassured. Even to question this was to be 'able-ist.'</p>
            <p>What if - Sarah asked her daughter - after choosing to transition she then felt the need to de-transition? What if having made this change she decided she didn't want it? Her daughter's response was, 'So. I'll kill myself.'</p>
            <p>When asked what harm could be done by waiting before transitioning she said, 'The biggest harm is not to do anything.' But what was the risk of waiting, she was asked. Her reply: 'The risk of waiting is suicide. The risk of waiting is running away. The risk of waiting is substance abuse. The risk of waiting is bullying and violence. The risk of waiting is depression and anxiety.' Joel Baum, who is Senior Director at the campaign group Gender Spectrum, has put this even more starkly. To parents worried about consenting to their children going on hormones he has said, 'You can either have grandchildren or not have a kid any more, either because they've ended the relationship with you or in some cases because they have chosen a more dangerous path for themselves.' <br>The problem with the choice being presented this way - in the most catastrophizing light possible - is that it leaves no room for discussion or dissent. Instead, the moment that achild says they think they may be of the opposite sex, they must be greeted only with acceptance and from then on only with a set of life-changing steps which an increasing body of professionals appear to want to encourage with as little pushback as possible.</p>
            <p>Even if there are some people who actually suffer from gender dysphoria, and even if for some of them life-changing surgery is the best possible option, how might they be differentiated from people who have such ideas suggested to them but who later turn out to have made the wrong decision for themselves?</p>
            <p>The demand that everyone should agree to use new gender pronouns and get used to people of the opposite sex being in the same bathrooms is at the relatively frivolous end of the spectrum of demands. Far more serious is the demand that children be encouraged towards medical intervention over a matter that is so incredibly unclear - and the age at which such children will be encouraged in this way will only keep going down. At the end of 2018 a private gender clinician in Wales was convicted in court of illegally providing healthcare services. Her clinic was providing sex-change hormones to children as young as 12.</p>
            <p>Anyone mentioning the drawbacks or concerns about going trans is said to be hateful and either encouraging violence against trans people or encouraging them to do themselves harm. This suggests that the only thing that non-trans people can do is stay silent on the issue and never speak about it unless what they have to say is affirming.</p>
            <p>The problem at present is not the disparity, but the certainty - the spurious certainty with which an enbelievably unclear issue is presented as though it was the clearest and best understood thing imaginable.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>To raise the plight of women, gays, people of different racial backgrounds and those who are trans has become not just a way to demonstrate comassion but a demonstration of a form of morality. It is how to practise this new religion. To 'fight' for these issues and to extol their cause has become a way of showing that you are a good person.</p>
            <p>There remain 73 countries in the world where it is illegal to be gay, and eight in which being gay is punishable by death. Incountries across the Middle East and Africa women are denied some of the most basic rights of all. Outbursts of inter-racial violence occur in country after country.</p>
            <p>Nowhere in the world are the rights of trans people to attempt to live their lives the way they wish more protected in law than in the developed West.</p>
            <p>But there is a paradox here: that the countries which are most advanced in all of these attainments are the ones now presented as among the worst.</p>
            <p>And it has not only to do with the arrival of new technologies, even though we are only one decade into the era of the smartphone and Twitter. Even before this, something had been going wrong in the language of human rights and the practice of liberalism. It is as though the enquiring aspect of liberalism was at some stage replaced with a liberal dogmatism: a dogmatism that insists questions are settled which are unsettled, that matters are known which are unknown and that we hav a very good idea of how to structure a society along inadequately argued lines.</p>
            <p>The metaphysics that a new generation is imbibing and everyone else is being force-fed has many points of instability, is grounded in a desire to express certainty about things we do not know, and to be wildly dismissive and relativistic about things that we actually do know. The foundations are that anyone might become gay, women might be better than men, people can become white but not black and anyone can change sex. That anyone who doesn't fit into this is an oppressor. And that absolutely everything should be made political.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the claims of the advocates of social justice, these categories do not in fact interact well with each other. The oppression matrix is not a great Rubik's cube waiting for every square to be lined up by social scientists. It consists of a set of demands which do not work together, and certainly not at this pitch.</p>
            <p>In terms of logical consistency Tuvel had avery good point: if people should be allowed to self-identify why should that right stop at the borders of race and not at the borders of sex?</p>
            <p>In 2018 an 18-year-old called Mack Beggs won the Texas girls' Class 6A 110lbs division wrestling title for the second year in a row. Beggs is transitioning from female to male and is taking doses of testosterone. Press write-ups of Beggs' victories have tended to focus on the boos from some members of the crowd as another female opponent is beaten, as though bigotry and small-mindedness are the real problem here...After all, in the sporting world, being discovered to have taken testosterone is ordinarily grounds to prevent someone from competing - unless, it turns out, the person is taking testosterone to transition to the opposite sex. In which case sensitivity overrides science. As always, it gets worse.</p>
            <p>As Rogan later put it, 'People came down on me harder than anything that I've ever stood up for in my life. Never in my life did I think there was going to be a situation where I said "Hey, I don't think a guy should be able to get his penis removed and beat the shit out of women" and then people were like "You're out of line." But that's literally what happened.'</p>
            <p>So here is another paradoxical, impossible demand. A person who chooses to be ridiculous without being ridiculed.</p>
            <p>He said, 'You cannot tell people simultaneously "You must understand me" and "You cannot understand me."' Evidently a whole lot of people can make those demands simultaneously. But they shouldn't, and if they do then they should realize that their contradictory demands cannot be granted.</p>
            <p>But how would they be arranged? Is a fat white person equal to a skinny person of colour? Or are there different scales of oppression which everyone should know even if no one has explained the rules because the rules are made not by rational people but by mob stampedes.</p>
            <p>The median income of Asian men in America is consistently higher than any other group, including white Americans. Should there be some attempt to level this figure out by bringing Asian men down a few earning percentiles? Perhaps we could get out of this mania by treating people as individuals based on their abilities and not trying to impose equity quotas on every company and institution?</p>
            <p>This finding might epitomize the confusion of our time. We see oppression where it doesn't exist and have no idea how to respond to it.</p>
            <p>If it is assumed that the primary purpose in life is to make as much money as possible, then it is indeed possible that having a child will constitute a 'penalty' for a woman and thereby prevent her from having a larger sum of money in her bank account when she dies. On the other hand, if she chooses to pay that 'penalty' she might be fortunate enough to engage in the most important and fulfilling role that a human being can have.</p>
            <p>Is this not a better way to think about motherhood and life? In a spirit of love and forgiveness rather than the endless register of resentment and greed?</p>
            <p>But the other reason why contradiction is not enough is because nothing about the intersectional, social justice movement suggests that it is really interested in solving any of the problems that it claims to be interested in...Few people think that a country cannot be improved on, but to present it as riddled with bigotry, hatred and oppression is at best a partial and at worst a nakedly hostile prism through which to view society. It is an analysis expressed not in the manner of a critic hoping to improve, but as an enemy eager to destroy. There are signs of this intention everywhere we look.</p>
            <p>A movement that sought to advance trans claims would start with intersex and from there move with enormous care along the spectrum of trans assertions, analyzing them with scientific precision in the process. It would not go straight to the hardest part of the claim and insist it is true and that everyone else must believe it is true too. That is not what you do if you are trying to build a coalition or a movement. It is what you do if you do not want to create a consensus. It is what you do if you are seeking to cause division.</p>
            <p>Their desire is not to heal but to divide, not to placate but to inflame, not to dampen but to burn. In this again the last part of a Marxist substructure can be glimpsed. If you cannot rule a society - or pretend to rule it, or try to rule it and collapse everything - then you can do something else. In a society that is alive to its faults, and though imperfect remains a better option than anything else on offer, you sow doubt, division, animosity and fear. Most effectively you can try to make people doubt absolutely everything. Make them doubt whether the society they live in is good at all. Make them doubt that people really are treated fairly. Make them doubt whether there are any such goupings as men or women. Make them doubt almost everything. And then present yourself as having the answers: the grand, overarching, interlocking set of answers that will bring everyone to some perfect place, the details of which will follow in the post.</p>
            <p>Rather than demonstrating an excess of oppression in our societies, the abundance of such claims may in fact be revealing a great shortage of it. If people were so oppressed would they have the time or inclination to listen to every person who felt the need to publicize that a talk by a novelist at a literary festival had upset them, or that it was intolerable to be sold a burrito by someone of the wrong ethnicity?</p>
            <p>Victimhood rather than stoicism or heroism has become something eagerly publicized, even sought after, in our culture. To be a victim is in some way to have won, or at least to have got a head start in the great oppression race of life.</p>
            <p>On his travels in America in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville noticed the significance of assembly in the United States - specifically that face-to-face meetings of the citizenry allowed them to remedy problems often before any other authority was needed. In <em>Democracy in America</em> he attributes a great power to this ability to assemble and observes that face-to-face contestation is not only the best way to get to a solution but that in such interactions 'opinions are deployed with the force and heat that written thought can never attain.'</p>
            <p>But minimizing difference is not the same as pretending difference does not exist. To assume that sex, sexuality and skin colour mean nothing would be ridiculous. But to assume that they mean everything will be fatal.</p>
