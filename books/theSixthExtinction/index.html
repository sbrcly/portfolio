            <h1>The Sixth Extinction</h1>
            <h3><em>Atelopus zeteki</em></h3>
            <p>A person walking along it would see so many golden frogs sunning themselves on the banks that, as one herpetologist who made the trip many times put it to me, "it was insane - absolutely insane."</p>
            <p>It was titled "Are We in the Midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction? A View from the World of Amphibians." The authors, David Wake, of the University of California-Berkeley, and Vance Vredenburg, of San Francisco State, noted that there "have been five great mass extinctions during the history of life on this planet." These extinctions they described as events that led to "a profound loss of biodiversity." The first took place during the late Ordovician period, some 450 million years ago, when living things were still mainly confined to the water. The most devastating took place at the end of the Permian period, some 250 million years ago, and it came perilously close to emptying the earth out altogether. (This event is sometimes referred to as "the mother of mass extinctions" or "the great dying.") The most recent - and famous - mass extinction came at the close of the Cretaceous period; it wiped out, in addition to the dinosaurs, the plesiosaurs, the mosasaurs, the ammonites, and the pterosaurs. Wake and Vredenburg argued that, based on extinction rates among amphibians, an event of a similarly catastrophic nature was currently under way.</p>
            <p>If Wake and Vredenburg were correct, then those of us alive today not only are witnessing one of the rarest events in life's history, we are also causing it.</p>
            <p>This means that amphibians have been around not just longer than mammals, say, or birds; they have been around since before there were dinosaurs. <br>Most amphibians - the word comes from the Greek meaning "double life" - are still closely tied to the aquatic realm from which they emerged.</p>
            <p>The same way acoustical engineers speak of "background noise" biologists talk about "background extinction." In ordinary times - times here understood to mean whole geologic epochs - extinction takes place only very rarely, more rarely even than speciation, and it occurs at what's known as the background extinction rate.</p>
            <p>Mass extinctions are different. Instead of a background hum there's a crash, and disappearance rates spike. Anthony Hallam and Paul Wignall, British paleontologists who have written extensively on the subject, define mass extinctions as events that eliminate a "significant proportion of the world's biota in a geologically insignificant amount of time." Another expert, David Jablonski, characterizes mass extinctions as "substantial biodiversity losses" that occur rapidly and are "global in extent." Michael Benton a paleontologist who has studied the end-Permian extinction, uses the metaphor of the tree of life: "During a mass extinction, vast swathes of the tree are cut short, as if attacked by crazed, axe-wielding madmen."</p>
            <p>"The history of life thus consists of "long periods of boredom interrupted occasionally by panic."</p>
            <p>In times of panic, whole groups of once-dominant organisms can disappear or be relegated to secondary roles, almost as if the globe has undergone a cast change.</p>
            <p>Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world's most endangered class of animals; it's been caluculated that the group's extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other goups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that on-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all fresh-water mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.</p>
            <p>There are all sorts of seemingly disparate reasons that species are disappearing. But trace the process far enough and inevitably you are led to the same culprit: "one weedy species."</p>
            <p>Either way, the etiology is the same. Without being loaded by someone onto a boat or a plane, it would have been impossible for a frog carrying Bd to get from Africa to Australia or from North America to Europe. This sort of intercontinental reshuffling, which nowadays we find totally unremarkable, is probably unprecedented in the three-and-a-half-billion-year history of life.</p>

            <h2>Chapter II</h2>
            <h1>The Mastodon's Molars</h1>
            <h3><em>Mammut americanum</em></h3>
            <p>The idea did not crop up during the Middle Ages or during the Renaissance, when the word "fossil" was used to refer to anything dug up from the ground (hence the term "fossil fuels"). In the Enlightenment, the prevailing view was that every species was a link in a great, unbreakable "chain of being." As Alexander Pope put it in his <em>Essay on Man:</em></p>
            <p class="subPara">All are but parts of one stupendous whole, <br>Whose body nature is, and God the soul.</p>
            <p>Extinction finally emerged as a concept, probably not coincidentally, in revolutionary France. It did so largely thanks to one animal, the creature now called the American mastodon, or <em>Mammut americanum</em>, and one man, the naturalist Jean-Leopold-Nicolas-Frederic Cuvier, known after a dead brother simply as Georges.</p>
            <p>On the basis of a few scattered bones, Cuvier had conceived of a whole new way of looking at life. Species died out. This was not an isolated but a widespread phenomenon.</p>
            <p>In fact, the American mastodon vanished around thirteen thousand years ago. Its demise was part of a wave of disappearances that has come to be known as the megafauna extinction. This wave coincided with the spread of modern humans and, increasingly, is understood to have been a result of it. In this sense, the crisis Cuvier discerned just beyond the edge of recorded history was us.</p>

            <h2>Chapter III</h2>
            <h1>The Original Penguin</h1>
            <h3><em>Pinguinus impennis</em></h3>
            <p>According to Lyell, every feature of the landscape was the result of very gradual processes operating over countless millennia - processes like sedimentation, erosion, and vulcanism, which were all still readily observable. For generations of geology students, Lyell's thesis would be summed up as "the present is the key to the past." <br>As far as extinction was concerned, this, too, according to Lyell, occurred at a very slow pace - so slow that, at any given time, in any given place, it would not be surprising were it to go unnoticed.</p>
            <p>All manner of organisms had existed in all eras, and those that had apparently vanished for good could, under the right circumstances, pop up again. Thus "the huge iguanodon might reappear in the woods, and the ichthyosaur in the sea, while the pterodactyle might flit again through umbrageous groves of tree-ferns." It is clear, Lyell wrote, "that there is no foundation in geological facts for the popular theory of the successive development of the animal and vegetable world." <br>Lyell published his ideas in three thick volumes, <em>Principles of Geology: Being an Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface by Reference to Causes Now in Operation</em>. The work was aimed at a general audience, which embraced it enthusiastically.</p>
            <p>Among the readers who snapped up the <em>Principles</em> was Charles Darwin.</p>
            <p>In the popular imagination, the journey is usually seen as the time when Darwin, encountering a wild assortment of giant tortoises, seafaring lizards, and finches with beaks of every imaginable shape and size, discovered natural selection. In fact, Darwin developed his theory only after his return to England, when other natuarlists sorted out the jumble of specimens he had shipped back. <br>It would be more accurate to describe the voyage of the <em>Beagle</em> as the period when Darwin discovered Lyell.</p>
            <p>The more Darwin explored the world, the more Lyellian it seemed to him to be.</p>
            <p>One biographer summed up Lyell's influence on Darwin as follows: "Without Lyell there would have been no Darwin." Darwin himself, after publishing his account of the voyage of the <em>Beagle</em> and also a volume on coral reefs, wrote, "I always feel as if my books came half out of Lyell's brains."</p>
            <p>With his theory of natural selection, Darwin once again "out-Lyelled" Lyell. Darwin recognized that just as the features of the inorganic world - deltas, river valleys, mountain chains - were brought into being by gradual change, the organic world similarly was subject to constant flux. Ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, birds and fish and - most discomfiting of all - humans had come into being through a process of transformation that took place over countless generations.</p>
            <p>In one of the most often-quoted passages of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, Darwin wrote.</p>
            <p class="subPara">It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers.</p>
            <p>Natural selection eliminated the need for any sort of creative miracles. Given enough time for "every variation, even the slightest" to accumulate, new species would emerge from the old.</p>
            <p>"The appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms: were, Darwin wrote, "bound together." Driving both was the "struggle for existence," which rewarded the fit and eliminated the less so.</p>
            <p>From Darwin's premises, an important prediction followed. If extinction was driven by natural selection and <em>only</em> by natural selection, the two processes had to proceed at roughly the same rate. If anything, extinction had to occur more gradually.</p>
            <p>No one had ever seen a new species produced, nor, according to Darwin, should they expect to. Speciation was so drawn out as to be, for all intents and purposes, unobservable. "We see nothing of these slow changes in progress," he wrote. It stood to reason that extinction should have been that much more difficult to witness. And yet it wasn't.</p>
            <p>As best as can be determined, great auks lived much as penguins do. In fact, great auks were the original "penguins."</p>
            <p>For Newton, the experience of the trip would prove to be life-altering. He concluded that the auk was gone - "for all practical purposes therefore we may speak of it as a thing of the past" - and he developed what one biographer referred to as a "peculiar attraction" to "extinct and disappearing faunas." Newton realized that the birds that bred along Britain's long coast were also in danger; he noted that they were being gunned down for sport in great numbers. <br>"The bird that is shot is a parent," he observed in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. "We take advantage of its most sacred instincts to waylay it, and in depriving the parent of life, we doom the helpless offspring to the most miserable of deaths, that by hunger. If this is not cruelty, what is?" Newton argued for a ban on hunting during breeding season, and his lobbying resulted in one of the first laws aimed at what today would be called wildlife protection: the Act for the Preservation of Sea Birds.</p>
            <p>As it happens, Darwin's first paper on natural selection appeared in print just as Newton was returning home from Iceland. The paper, in the <em>Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society</em>, had - with Lyell's help - been published in a rush soon after Darwin had learned that a young naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace was onto a similar idea...Newton read Darwin's essay very soon after it came out, staying up late into the night to finish it, and he immediately became a convert. "It came to me like the direct revelation of a higher power," he later recalled, "and I awoke next morning with the consiousness that there was an end of all the mystery in the simple phrase, 'Natural Selection.'" He had, he wrote to a friend, developed a case of "pure and unmitigated Darwinism."</p>
            <p>Darwin's familiarity with human-caused extinction is also clear from <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. In one of the many passages in which he heaps scorn on the catastrophists, he observes that animals inevitably become rare before they become extinct: "we know this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally or wholly, through man's agency."</p>
            <p>He himself seems to find nothing remarkable or troubling about this. But human-caused extinction is of course troubling for many reasons, some of which have to do with Darwin's own theory, and it's puzzling that a writer as shrewd and self-critical as Darwin shouldn't have noticed this. <br>In the <em>Origin</em>, Darwin drew no distinction between man and other organisms. As he and many of his contemporaries recognized, this equivalence was the most radical aspect of his work. Humans, just like any other species, were descended, with modification, from more ancient forebears. Even those qualities that seemed to set people apart - language, wisdom, a sense of right and wrong - had evolved in the same manner as other adaptive traits, such as longer beaks or sharper incisors. At the heart of Darwin's theory, as one of his biographers has put it, is "the denial of humanity's special status." <br>And what was true of evolution should aslo hold for extinction, since according to Darwin, the latter was merely a side effect of the former. Species were annihilated, just as they were created, by "slow-acting and still existing causes," which is to say, throught competition and natural selection; to invoke any other mechanism was nothing more than mystification. But how, then, to make sense of cases like the great auk or the Charles Island tortoise over the course of Darwin's own lifetime. Either ther had to be a separate category for human-caused extinction, in which case people really <em>did</em> deserve their "special status" as a creature outside of nature, or space in the natural order had to be made for cataclysm, in which case, Cuvier - distressingly - was right.</p>

            <h1>The Luck of the Ammonites</h1>
            <h3><em>Discoscaphites jerseyensis</em></h3>
            <p>Iridium is extremely rare on the surface of the earth but much more common in meteorites.</p>
            <p>There was something seriously wrong with the samples from the clay layer. The amount of iridium in them was off the charts.</p>
            <p>A third set of samples, from the South Island of New Zealand, also showed an iridium "spike" right at the end of the Cretaceous.</p>
            <p>Then, finally, after almost a year's worth of dead ends, they arrived at the impact hypothesis. On an otherwise ordinary day sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid six miles wide collided with the earth. Exploding on contact, it released energy on the order of a hundred million megatons of TNT, or more than a million of the most powerful H-bombs ever tested. Debris, including iridium from the pulverized asteroid, spread around the globe. Day turned to night, and temperatures plunged. A mass extinction ensued.</p>
            <p>The Alvarezes' paper, "extraterrestrial Cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Exctinction," was published in June 1980.</p>
            <p>In 1841, John Phillips, a contemporary of Lyell's who succeeded him as president of the Geological Society of London, divided life into three chapters. He called the first the Paleozoic, from the Greek for "ancient life," the second the Mesozoic, meaning "middle life," and the third the Cenozoic, "new life." Phillips fixed as the dividing point between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic what would now be called the end-Permian extinction, and between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, the end-Cretaceous event.</p>
            <p>It's impossible to give anything close to a full account of the various species, genera, families, and even whole orders that went extinct at the K-T boundary. On land, every animal larger than a cat seems to have died out. The event's most famous victims, the dinosaurs - or, to be more precise, the non-avian dinosaurs - suffered a hundred percent losses.</p>
            <p>Birds were also hard-hit; perhaps three-quarters of all bird families, perhaps more, went extinct.</p>
            <p>The same goes for lizards and snakes; around four-fifths of all species vanished. Mammals' ranks, too, were devaastated; something like two-thirds of the mammalian families living at the end of the Cretaceous disappear at the boundary.</p>
            <p>Several groups of marine microorganisms came within a micron or two of annihilation.</p>
            <p>In general, the more that's been learned about the K-T boundary, the more wrongheaded Lyell's reading of the fossil record appears. The problem with the record is not that slow extinctions appear abrupt. It's that even abrupt extinctions are likely to look protracted.</p>
            <p>Following the K-T extinction, it took millions of years for life to recover its former level of diversity.</p>
            <p>Everything (and everyone) alive today is descended from an organism that somehow survived the impact.</p>

            <h2>Chapter V</h2>
            <h1>Welcome To The Anthropocene</h1>
            <h3><em>Dicranograptus ziczac</em></h3>
            <p>The psychologists wrote up their findings in a paper titled "On the Perception of Incongruity: A Paradigm."</p>
            <p>Signs of mismatch are disregarded for as long as possible - the red spade looks "brown" or "rusty." At the point the anomaly becomes simply too glaring, a crisis ensues - what the psychologists dubbed the "'My God!' reaction."</p>
            <p>This pattern was, Kuhn argued in his seminal work, <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, so basic that it shaped not only individual perceptions but entire fields of inquiry. Data that did not fit the commonly accepted assumptions of a discipline would either be discounted or explained away for as long as possible.</p>
            <p>"In science, as in the playing card experiment, novelty emerges only with difficulty," Kuhn wrote. But then, finally, someone came along who was willing to call a red spade a red spade. Crisis led to insight, and the old framework gave way to a new one. This is how great scientific discoveries or, to use the term Kuhn made so popular, "paradigm shift" took place.</p>
            <p>This history of the science of extinction can be told as a series of paradigm shifts. Until the end of the eighteenth century, the very category of extinction didn't exist. The more strange bones were unearthed - mammoths, <em>Megatherium</em>, mosasaurs - the harder naturalists had to squint to fit them into a familiar framework. And squint they did.</p>
            <p>The uniformitarian account of extinction held up for more than a century. Then, with the discovery of the iridium layer, science faced another crisis. (According to one historian, the Alarezes' work was "as explosive for science as an impact would have been for earth.") The impact hypothesis dealt with a single moment in time - a terrible, horrible, no-good day at the end of the Cretaceous. But that single moment was enough to crack the framework of Lyell and Darwin. Catastrophes <em>did</em> happen.</p>
            <p>In this sense the reigning paradigm is neither Cuvierian nor Darwinian but combines key elements of both - "long periods of boredome interrupted occasionally by panic." Though rare, these moments of panic are disproportionately important. They determine the pattern of extinction, which is to say, the pattern of life.</p>
            <p>The Ordovician period followed directly after the Cambrian, which is known, even to the most casual of geology students, for the "explosion" of new life forms that appeared. The Ordovician, too, was a time when life took off excitedly in new directions - the so-called Ordovician radiation - though it remained, for the most part, still confined to the water.</p>
            <p>Toward the middle of the Ordovician, the first plants began to colonize the land. These were very early mosses or liverworts, and they clung low to the ground, as if not quite sure what to make of their new surroundings. <br>At the end of the Ordovician, some 444 million years ago, the oceans emptied out. Something like eighty-five percent of marine species died off. For a long time, the event was regarded as one of those pseudo-catastrophes that just went to show how little the fossil record could be trusted. Today, it's seen as the first of the Big Five extinctions, and it's thought to have taken place in two brief, intensely deadly pulses.</p>
            <p>The study revealed that in addition to the five major mass extinctions, there had been many lesser extinction events. When all of these were considered together, a pattern emerged: mass extinctions seemed to take place at regular intervals of roughly twenty-six million years. Extinction, in other words, occurred in periodic bursts, like cicadas crawling out of the earth.</p>
            <p>The current theory is that the end-Ordovician extinction was caused by glaciation. For most of the period, a so-called greenhouse climate prevailed - carbon dioxide levels in the air were high and so, too, were sea levels and temperatures. But right around the time of the first pulse of extinction - the one that wreaked havoc among the graptolites - CO<sub>2</sub> levels dropped. Temperatures fell and Gondwana froze. Evidence of the Ordovician glaciation has been found in such far-flung remnants of the supercontinent as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Brazil.</p>
            <p>The end-Permian extinction also seems to have been triggered by a change in the climate. But in this case, the change went in the opposite direction. Right at the time of extinction, 252 million years ago, there was a massive release of carbon into the air - so massive that geologists have a hard time even imagining where all the carbon could have come from. Temperatures soared - the seas warmed by as much as eighteen degrees - and the chemistry of the oceans went haywire, as if in an out-of-control aquarium. The water became acidified, and the amount of dissolved oxygen dropped so low that many organisms probably, in effect, suffocated. Reefs collapsed. The end-Permian extinction took place, though not quite in a human lifetime, in geologic terms nearly as abruptly; according to the latest research by Chinese and American scientists, the whole episode lasted no more than two hundred thousand years, and perhaps less than a hundred thousand. By the time it was over, something like ninety percent of all species on earth had been eliminated. Even intense global warming and ocean acidification seem inadequate to explain losses on such a staggering scale, and so additional mechanisms are still being sought.</p>
            <p>The sulfate-reducing bacteria changed the color of the oceans and the hydrogen sulfide the color of the heavens; the science writer Carl Zimmer has described the end-Permian world as a "truly grotesque place" where glassy, purple seas released poisonous bubbles that rose "to a pale green sky."</p>
            <p>"...We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be caused by human beings. So it's clear that we do not have a general theory of mass extinction."</p>
            <p>Zalasiewicz is convinced that even a moderately competent stratigrapher will, at the distance of a hundred million years or so, be able to tell that something extraordinary happened at the moment in time that counts for us as today. This is the case even though a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man - the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories - will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper. "We have already left a record that is now indelible," Zalasiewicz has written.</p>
            <p>Climate change - itself a driver of extinction - will aslo leave behind geologic traces, as will nuclear fallout and river diversion and monoculture farming and ocean acidification.</p>
            <p>For all of these reasons, Zalasiewicz believes that we have entered a new epoch, which has no analog in earth's history. "Geologically," he has observed, "this is a remarkable episode."</p>
            <p>Crutzen wrote up his idea in a short essay, "geology of Manking," that ran in <em>Nature</em>. "It seems appropriate to assign the term 'Anthropocene' to the present, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch," he observed. Among the many geologic-scale changes people have effected, Crutzen cited the following:</p>
            <p class="subPara">• Human activity has transformed between a third and a half of the land surface of the planet. <br>• Most of the world's major rivers have been dammed or diverted. <br>• Fertilizer plants produce more nitrogen than is fixed naturally by all terrestrial ecosystems. <br>• Fisheries remove more than a third of the primary production of the oceans' costal waters. <br>• Humans use more than half of the world's readily accessible fresh water runoff.</p>
            <p>Most significantly, Crutzen said, people have altered the composition of the atmosphere. Owing to a combination of fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air has risen by forty percent over the last two centuries, while the concentration of methane, an even more potent green-house gas, has more than doubled.</p>
            <p>(To geologists, an epoch is a subdivision of a period, which, in turn, is a division of an era: the Holocene, for instance, is an epoch of the Quaternary, which is a period in the Cenozoic.)</p>

            <h2>Chapter VI</h2>
            <h1>The Sea Around Us</h1>
            <h3><em>Patella caerulea</em></h3>
            <p>Carbon dioxide has many interesting properties, one of which is that it dissolves in water to form an acid.</p>
            <p>Since the start of the industrial revolution, humans have burned through enough fossil fuels - coal, lil, and natural gas - to add some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. Deforestation has contributed another 180 billion tons. Each year, we throw up another nine billion tons or so, an amount that's been increasing by as much as six percent annually. As a result of all this, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air today - a little over four hundred parts per million - is higher than at any other point in the las eight hundred thousand years. Quite probably it is higher than at any point in the last several million years. If current trends continue, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will top five hundred parts per million, roughly double the levels they were in preindustrial days, by 2050. It is expected that such an increase will produce an eventual average global temperature rise of between three and a half and seven degrees Fahrenheit, and this will, in turn, trigger a variety of world-altering events, including the disappearance of most remaining glaciers, the inundation of low-lying islands and coastal cities, and the melting of the Arctic ice cap. But this is only half the story. <br>Ocean covers seventy percent of the earth's surface, and everywhere that water and air come into contact there's an exchange. Gases from the atmosphere get absorbed by the ocean and gases dissolved in the ocean are released into the atmosphere. When the two are in equilibriumn roughly the same quantities are being dissolved as are being released. Change the atmosphere's composition, as we have done, and the exchange becomes lopsided: more carbon dioxide enters the water than comes back out. In this way, humans are constantly adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the seas, much as the vents do, but from above rather than below and on a global scale. This year alone the oceans will absorb two and a half billion tons of carbon, and next year it is expected they will absorb another two and a half billion tons. Every day, every American in effect pumps seven pounds of carbon into the sea. <br>Thanks to all this extra CO<sub>2</sub>, the pH of the oceans' surface waters has already dropped, from an average of around 8.2 to an average of around 8.1. Like the Richter scale, the pH scale is logarithmic, so even such a small numerical difference represents a very large real world change. A decline of .1 means that the oceans are now thirty percent more acidic than they were in 1800. Assuming that humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the oceans will continue to absorb carbon dioxide and will become increasingly acidified. Under what's known as a "business as usual" emissions scenario, surface ocean pH will fall to 8.0 by the middle of this century, and it will drop to 7.8 by the century's end. At that point, the oceans will be 150 percent more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial revolution. <br>Owing to the CO<sub>2</sub> pouring out of the vents, the waters around Castello Aragonese provide a near-perfect preview of what lies ahead for the oceans more generally.</p>
            <p>As you move closer the the vents, the acidity of the water increases and the pH declines. A map of life along this pH gradient, Hall-Spencer reasoned, would represent a map of what lies ahead for the world's oceans. It would be like having access to an underwater time machine.</p>
            <p>In this vent-free zone, sixty-nine species of animals and fifty-one species of plants were counted.</p>
            <p>All told, one-third of the species found in the vent-free zone were no-shows in the pH 7.8 zone.</p>
            <p>"If you ask me what's going to happen in the future, I think the strongest evidence we have is there is going to be a reduction in biodiversity," Riebesell told me. "some highly tolearnt organisms will become more abundant, but overall diversity will be lost. This is what has happened in all these times of major mass extinction."</p>
            <p>No single mechanism explains all the mass extinctions in the record, and yet changes in ocean chemistry seem to be a pretty good predictor. Ocean acidification played a role in at least two of the Big Five extinctions (the end-Permian and the end-Triassic) and quite possibly it was a major factor in a third (the end-Cretaceous).</p>
            <p>Ocean acidification increases the cost of calcification by reducing the number of carbonate ions available to begin with. To extend the construction metaphor, imagine trying to build a house while someone keeps stealing your bricks.</p>
            <p>Lab experiments have indicated that calcifiers will be particularly hard-hit by falling ocean pH, and the list of the disappeared at Castello Aragonese confirms this. In the pH 7.8 zone, three-quarters of the missing species are calcifiers.</p>
            <p>Roughly one-third of the CO<sub>2</sub> that humans have so far pumped into the air has been absorbed by the oceans. This comes to a stunning 150 billion metric tons. As with most aspects of the Anthropocene, though, it's not only the scale of the transfer but also the speed that's significant.</p>
            <p>If we were adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the air more slowly, geophysical processes, like the weathering of rock, would come into play to counteract acidification. As it is, things are moving too fast for such slow-acting forces to keep up.</p>
            <p>It turns out there just aren't many ways to inject billions of tons of carbon into the air very quickly. The best explanation anyone has come up with for the end-Permian extinction is a massive burst of vulcanism in what's now Siberia. But even this spectacular event, which created the formation known as the Siberian Traps, probably released, on an annual basis, less carbon than our cars and factories and power plants.</p>
            <p>In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.</p>

            <h1>Dropping Acid</h1>
            <h3><em>Acropora millepora</em></h3>
            <p>Reefs are organic paradoxes - obdurate, ship-destroying ramparts constructed by tiny gelatinous creatures. They are part animal, part vegetable, and part mineral, at once teeming with life and, at the same time, mostly dead.</p>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef extends, discontinuously, for more than fifteen hundred miles, and in some places it is five hundred feet thick. By the scale of reefs, the pyramids at Giza are kiddie blocks. <br>The way corals change the world - with huge construction projects spanning multiple generations - might be likened to the way that humans do, with this crucial difference. Instead of displacing other creatures, corals support them. Thousands -perhaps millions - of species have evolved to rely on coral reefs, either directly for protection or food, or indirectly, to prey on those species that come seeking protection or food.</p>
            <p>A paper published by <em>Nature</em> by the former head of the One Tree Island Research Station, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, predicted that if current trends continue, then by around 2050 visitors to the Great Barrier Reef will arrive to find "rapidly eroding rubble banks."</p>
            <p>Since corals like light but can't survive long exposure to the air, they tend to grow as high as the water level at low tide and then spread out laterally.</p>
            <p>Yet curiously enough, the first evidence that CO<sub>2</sub> could kill a reef came from Arizona, from the self-enclosed, supposedly self-sufficient world known as Biosphere 2.</p>
            <p>A three-acre, glassed-in structure shaped like a ziggurat, Biosphere 2 was built in the late nineteen-eighties by a private group largely funded by the billionaire Edward Bass. It was intended to demonstrate how life on earth - Biosphere 1 - could be re-created on, say, Mars. The building contained a "rainforest," a "desert," an "agricultural zone," and an artificial "ocean."</p>
            <p>Although the effects of acidification are generally expressed in terms of pH, there's another way to look at what's going on that's just as important - to many organisms probably more important - and this is in terms of a property of seawater known, rather cumbersomely, as the "saturation state with respect to calcium carbonate," or, alternatively, the "saturation state with respect to aragonite." (Calcium carbonate comes in two different forms, depending on its crystal structure; aragonite, which is the form corals manufacture, is the more soluble variety.) The saturation state is determined by a comoplicated chemical formula; essentially, it's a measure of the concentration of calcium and carbonate ions floating around. When CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in water, if forms carbonic acid - H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> - which effectively "eats" carbonate ions, thus lowering the saturation state.</p>
            <p>The experiment took more than three years to complete and yielded more than a thousand measurements. It revealed a more or less linear relationship between the growth rate of the corals and the saturation state of the water. Corals grew fastest at an aragonite saturation state of five, slower at four, and still slower at three. At a level of two, they basically quit building, like frustrated contractors throwing up their hands. In the artificial world of Biosphere 2, the implications of this discovery were interesting. In the real world - Biosphere 1 - they were rather more worrisome.</p>
            <p>Prior to the industrial revolution, all of the world's major reefs could be found in water with an aragonite saturation state between four and five. Today, there's almost no place left on the planet where the saturation state is above four, and if current emissions trends continue, by 2060 there will be no regions left above 3.5. By 2100, none will remain above three. As saturation levels fall, the energy required for calcification will increase, and calcification rates will decline. Eventually, saturation levels may drop so low that corals quit calcifying altogether, but long before that point, they will be in trouble. This is because out in the real world, reefs are constantly being eaten away at by fish and sea urchins and burrowing worms. They are also being battered by waves and storms, like the one that created One Tree. Thus, just to hold their own, reefs must always be growing.</p>
            <p>A recent study by a team of Australian researchers found that coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef has declined by fifty percent just in the last thirty years.</p>
            <p>The paper concluded that if current emissions trends continue, within the next fifty years or so "all coral reefs will cease to grow and start to dissolve."</p>
            <p>Reefs are often compared to rainforests, and in terms of the sheer variety of life, the comparison is apt.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that at least half a million and possibly as many as nine million species spend at least part of their lives on coral reefs.</p>
            <p>Tropical waters tend to be low in nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, which are crucial to most forms of life. (This has to do with what's called the thermal structure of the water column, and it's why troopical waters are often so beautifully clear.) As a consequence, the seas in the troopics should be barren - the aqueous equivalent of deserts. Reefs are thus not just underwater rainforests; they are rainforests in a marine Sahara. The first person to be perplexed by this incongruity was Darwin, and it has since become known as "Darwin's paradox."</p>
            <p>Bothe rugose corals and tabulate corals were only distantly related to today's scleractinian corals, and both orders died out in the great extinction at the end of the Permian. This extinction shows up in the geologic record as (among other things) a "reef gap" - a period of about ten million years when reefs went missing altogether. Reef gaps also occurred after the late Devonian and the late Triassic extinctions, and in each of these cases it also took millions of years for reef construction to resume.</p>
            <p>Ocean acidification is, of course, not the only threat reefs are under. Indeed, in some parts of the world, reefs probably will not last long enough for ocean acidification to finish them off. The roster of perils includes, but is not limited to: overfishing, which promotes the growth of algae that compete with corals; agricultural runoff, which also encourages algae growth; deforestation, which leads to siltation and reduces water clarity; and dynamite fishing, whose destructive potential would seem to be self-explanatory.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent. <br>Finally and perhaps most significant on the list of hazards is climate change - ocean acidification's equally evil twin. <br>Tropical reefs need warmth, but when water temperatures rise too high, trouble ensues.</p>
            <p>A study of more than eight hundred reef-building coral species, published in <em>Science</em> in 2008, found a third of them to be in danger of extinction, largely as a result of rising ocean temperatures.</p>
            <p>I also felt, as I had several times at One Tree, the incongruity of my position. The reason I'd come to the Great Barrier Reef was to write about the scale of human influence. And yet Schneider and I seemed very, very small in the unbroken dark.</p>

            <h2>Chapter VIII</h2>
            <h1>The Forest and the Trees</h1>
            <h3><em>Alzatea verticillata</em></h3>
            <p>In the popular imagination, global warming is mostly seen as a threat to cold-loving species, and there are good reasons for this. As the world warms, the poles will be transformed. In the Arctic, perennial sea ice covers just half the area it did thirty years ago, and thirty years from now, it may well be gone entirely. Obviously, any animal that depends on the ice - ringed seals, say, or polar bears - is going to be hard-pressed as it melts away. <br>But global warming is going to have just as great an impact - indeed, according to Silman, an even greater impact - in the tropics. The reasons for this are somewhat more complicated, but they start with the fact that the tropics are where most species actually live.</p>
            <p>As a general rule, the variety of life is most impoverished at the poles and richest at low altitudes. This pattern is referred to in the scientific literature as the "latitudinal diversity gradient," or LDG, and it was noted already by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who was amazed by the biological splendors of the tropics, which offer "a spectacle as varied as the azure vault of the heavens."</p>
            <p>It is now generally believed that ice ages are initiated by small changes in the earth's orbit, caused by, among other things, the gravitational tug of Jupiter and Saturn. These changes alter the distribution of sunlight across different latitudes at different time of year. When the amount of light hitting the far northern latitudes in summer approaches a minimum, snow begins to build up there. This initiates a feedback cycle that causes atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to drop. Temperatures fall, which leads more ice to build up, and so on. After a while, the orbital cycle enters a new phase, and the feedback loop begins to run in reverse. The ice starts to melt, global CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, and the ice melts back farther. <br>During the Pleistocene, this freeze-thaw pattern was repeated some twenty times, with world-altering effects.</p>
            <p>In its magnitude, the temperature change projected for the coming century is roughly the same as the temperature swings of the ice ages. (If current emissions trends continue, the Andes are expected to warm by as much as nine degrees.) But if the magnitude of the change is similar, the rate is not, and, once again, rate is key. Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it.</p>
            <p>In ecology, rules are hard to come by. One of the few that's universally accepted is the "species-area relationship," or SAR, which has been called the closest thing the discipline has to a periodic table.</p>
            <p>The correlation between the number of species and the size of the area is not linear. Rather, it's a curve that slopes in a predictable way. Usually, the relationship is expressed by the formula <em>S = cA<sup>z</sup></em>, where <em>S</em> is the number of species, <em>A</em> is the size of the area, and <em>c</em> and <em>z</em> are constants that vary according to the region and taxonomic group under consideration (and hence are not really constants in the usual sense of the term). The relationship counts as a rule because the ratio holds no matter what the terrain. You could be studying a chain of islands or a rainforest or a nearby state park, and you'd find that the number of species varies according to the same insistent equation: <em>S = cA<sup>z</sup></em>.</p>
            <p>Thus, he's observed, "around 10 or more percent of species, and not 1 percent, or .01 percent," are likely to be done in by climate change.</p>
            <p>Certain types of insects depend on certain types of trees, and certain sorts of birds depend on those insects, and so on up the food chain. The reverse is also true: animals are critical to the survival of the forest. They are the pollinators and seed dispersers, and the birds prevent the insects from taking over. At the very least, Silman's work suggests, global warming will restructure ecological communities.</p>
            <p>For most of the Pleistocene temperatures were significantly lower than they are now - such is the rhythm of the orbital cycle that glacial periods tend to last much longer than interglacials - and so an evolutionary premium was placed on being able to deal with wintry conditions. Meanwhile, for two and a half million years, there's been no advantage in being able to deal with extra heat, since temperatures never got much warmer than they are right now. In the ups and downs of the Pleistocene, we are at the crest of an up.</p>

            <h2>Chapter IX</h2>
            <h1>Islands on Dry Land</h1>
            <h3><em>Eciton burchellii</em></h3>
            <p>Currently, about fifty million square miles of land on the planet are ice-free, and this is the baseline that's generally used for calculating human impacts. According to a recent study published by the Geological Society of America, people have "directly transformed" more than half of this land - roughly twenty-seven million square miles - mostly by converting it to cropland and pasture, but also by building cities and shopping malls and reservoirs, and by logging and mining and quarrying.</p>
            <p>But if a lack of suitable habitat were the only issue, land-bridge islands should pretty quickly stabilize at a new, lower level of diversity. Yet they don't. They keep on bleeding species - a process that's known by the surprisingly sunny term "relaxation." On some land-bridge islands that were created by rising sea levels at the end of the Pleistocene, it's been estimated that full relaxation took thousands of years; on others, the process may still be going on.</p>
            <p>What distinguishes islands - and explains the phenomenon of relaxation - is that recolonization is so difficult, in many cases, effectively impossible. (While a land-bridge island may support a small remnant population of, say, tigers, if that population winks out, new tigers presumably aren't going to paddle over.)</p>
            <p>One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it's changing in ways that create barriers - roads, clear-cuts, cities - that prevent them from doing so.</p>
            <p>"They're as confused as we are," Cohn-Haft said. He speculated that the ants had been moving their bivouac and had now gone into what is known as their statary phase. During this phase, the ants stay more or less in one place to raise a new generation. The statary phase can last for up to three weeks, which helps explain one of the more puzzling discoveries to come out of the BDFFP: even forest fragments large enough to support colonies of army ants end up losing their antbirds. Obligate ant-followers need foraging ants to follow, and apparently in the fragments there just aren't enough colonies to insure that one will always be active. Here again, Cohn-Haft told me, was a demonstration of the rainforest's logic. The antbirds are so good at doing "exactly what they do" that they're extremely sensitive to any change that makes their particular form of doing more difficult.</p>

            <h2>Chapter X</h2>
            <h1>The New Pangaea</h1>
            <h3><em>Myotis lucifugus</em></h3>
            <p>Without human help, long-distance travel is for most species difficult, bordering on impossible. This fact was, to Darwin, central.</p>
            <p>The movement of species around the world is sometimes compared to Russian roulette. As in the high-stakes game, two very different things can happen when a new organism shows up. The first, which might be called the empty chamber option, is nothing. Either because the climate is unsuitable, or because the creature can't find enough to eat, or because it gets eaten itself, or for a host of other possible reasons, the new arrival doesn't survive (or at least fails to reproduce).</p>
            <p>In the second option, not only does the introduced organism survive; it gives rise to a new generation, This is what's known in the invasive species community as "establishment."</p>
            <p>...a certain number complete the third step in the invasion process, which is "spread."</p>
            <p>Roy van Driesche, an expert on invasive species at the University of Massachusetts, has estimated that out of every hundred potential introductions, somewhere between five and fifteen will succeed in establishing themselves. Of these five to fifteen, one will turn out to be the "bullet in the chamber."</p>
            <p>Why some introduced species are able to proliferate explosively is a matter of debate.</p>
            <p>What <em>Boiga irregularis</em> has done in Guam, he observes, "is precisely what <em>Homo sapiens</em> has done all over the planet: succeeded extravagantly at the expense of other species."</p>
            <p>From the standpoint of the world's biota, global travel represents a radically new phenomenon and, at the same time, a replay of the very old. The drifting apart of the continents that Wegener deduced from the fossil record is now being reversed - another way in which humans are running geologic history backward and at high speed. Think of it as a souped-up version of plate tectonics, minus the plates. By transporting Asian species to North America, and North American species to Australia, and Australian species to Africa, and European species to Antarctica, we are, in effect, reassembling the world into one enormous supercontinent - what biologists sometimes refer to as the New Pangaea.</p>
            <p>The study of invasives is often said to have begun with Charles Elton, a British biologist who published his seminal work, <em>The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants</em>, in 1958. To explain the apparently paradoxical effects of moving species around, Elton used the analogy of a set of glass tanks. Imagine that each of the tanks is filled with a different solution of chemicals. Then imagine every tank connected to its neighbors by long, narrow tubes. If the taps to the tubes were left open for just a minute each day, the solutions would slowly start to diffuse. The chemicals would recombine. Some new compounds would form and some of the original compounds would drop out. "It might take quite a long time before the whole system came into equilibrium," Ellon wrote. Eventually, though, all of the tanks would hold the same solution. The variety would have been eliminated, which was just what could be expected to happen by bringing long-isolated plants and animals into contact.</p>

            <h2>Chapter XI</h2>
            <h1>The Rhino Gets an Ultrasound</h1>
            <h3><em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em></h3>
            <p>In an ironic twist, humans have brought the species so low that it seems only heroic human efforts can save it.</p>
            <p>A hundred years ago, in Africa, the population of black rhinos approached a million; it has since been reduced to around five thousand animals. The white rhino, also from Africa, is the only rhino species not currently classified as threatened.</p>
            <p>Of the worlds eight species of bears, six are categorized either as "vulnerable" to extinction or "endangered." Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations. African elephants are doing better, but, like rhinos, they're increasingly threatened by poaching.</p>
            <p>The same goes for other so-called mega-herbivores; full-grown elephants and hippos are so large that no animal dares attack them. Bears and big cats are similarly beyond predation.</p>
            <p>If climate change drove the megafauna extinct, then this presents yet another reason to worry about what we are doing to global temperatures. If, on the other hand, people were to blame - and it seems increasingly likely that they were - then the import is almost more disturbing. It would mean that the current extinction event began all the way back in the middle of the las ice age. It would mean that man was a killer - to use the term of art an "overkiller" - pretty much right from the start.</p>
            <p>There are several lines of evidence that argue in favor - or really against - humans. One of these is the event's timing. The mega-fauna extinction, it's now clear, did not take place all at once, as Lyell and Wallace believed it had. Rather, it occurred in pulses. The first pulse, about forty thousand years ago, took out Australia's giants. A second pulse hit North America and South America some twenty-five thousand years later. Madagascar's giant lemurs, pygmy hippos, and elephant birds survived all the way into the Middle Ages. New Zealand's moas made it as far as the Renaissance.</p>
            <p>It's hard to see how such a sequence could be squared with a single climate change event. The sequence of the pulses and the sequence of human settlement meanwhile, line up almost exactly.</p>
            <p>Megaherbivores generate mega amounts of shit, as is clear to anyone who's ever spent time standing behind a rhino. The ordure provides sustenance to fungi known as <em>Sporormiella</em>.</p>
            <p>They found that fifty thousand years ago, <em>Sporormiella</em> counts in the area were high. Then, rather abruptly around forty-one thousand years ago, <em>Sporormiella</em> counts dropped almost to zero.</p>
            <p>If climate drove the megafauna to extinction, a shift in vegetation should <em>precede</em> a drop in <em>Sporormiella</em>: first the landscape would have changed, then the animals that depended on the original vegetation would have disappeared. But just the opposite had happened. The team concluded that the only explanation that fit the data was "overkill." <em>Sporormiella</em> counts dropped prior to changes in the landscape because the death of the megafauna <em>caused</em> the landscape to change. With no more large herbivores around to eat away at the forest, fuel built up, which led to more frequent and more intense fires. This, in turn, pushed the vegetation toward fire-tolerant species.</p>
            <p>Those researchers who persist in believing that climate change killed the megafauna say that the certainty of Martin, Diamond, and Johnson is misplaced. In their view, nothing has been proved about the event, "categorically" or otherwise, and everything in the preceding paragraphs is oversimplified. The dates of the extinctions are not clear-cut; they don't line up neatly with human migration; and, in any case, correlation is not causation. Perhaps most profoundly, they doubt the whole premise of ancient human deadliness. How could small bands of technologically primitive people have wiped out so many large, strong, and in some cases fierce animals over an area the size of Australia or North America?</p>
            <p>Like the V-shaped graptolites or the ammonites or the dinosaurs, the megafauna weren't doing anything wrong; it's just that when humans appeared, "the rules of the survival game" changed.</p>
            <p>When Alroy ran the simulations for North America, he found that even a very small initial population of humans - a hundred or so individuals - could, over the course of a millennium or two, multiply sufficiently to account for pretty much all of the extinctions in the record. This was the case even when the people were assumed to be only fair-to-middling hunters. All they had to do was pick off a mammoth or a giant ground sloth every so often, when the opportunity arose, and keep this up for several centuries.</p>
            <p>From an earth history perspective, several hundred years or even several thousand is practically no time at all. From a human perspective, though, it's an immensity. For the people involved in it, the decline of the megafauna would have been so slow as to be imperceptible.</p>
            <p>It demonstrates, he has written, that humans "are capable of driving virtually any large mammal species extinct, even though they are also capable of going to great lengths to guarantee that they do not."</p>
            <p>Before humans emerged on the scene, being large and slow to reproduce was a highly successful strategy, and outsized creatures dominated the planet. Then, in what amounts to a geologic instant, this strategy became a loser's game. And so it remains today, which is why elephants and bears and big cats are in so much trouble and why Suci is one of the world's last remaining Sumatran rhinos. Meanwhile, eliminating the megafauna didn't just eliminate the megafauna; in Australia at least it set off an ecological cascade that transformed the landscape. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it's not clear that he ever really did.</p>

            <p>For the past twenty-five years or so, the study of human evolution has been dominated by the theory known in the popular press as "Out of Africa" and in academic circles as the "recent single-origin" or "replacement" hypothesis. This theory holds that all modern humans are descended from a small population that lived in Africa roughly two hundred thousand years ago.</p>

            <h1>The Thing With Feathers</h1>
            <h3><em>Homo sapiens</em></h3>
            <p>To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more and were willing to make more sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter whether people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.</p>
            <p>In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility - the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity - is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our "transformation of the ecological landscape." The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth's biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems - cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans - we're putting our own survival in danger.</p>
            <p>Another possibility - considered by some to be more upbeat - is that human ingenuity will outrun any disaster human ingenuity sets in motion. There are serious scientists who argue, for instance, that should global warming become too grave a threat, we can counteract it by reengineering the atmosphere...If none of this works and things really go south, there are those who maintain people will still be OK; we'll simply decamp to other planets.</p>
            <p>Right now, in the amazing moment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed. No other creature has ever managed this, and it will, unfortunately, be our most enduring legacy.</p>
