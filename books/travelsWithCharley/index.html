                <p>In this a journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it.</p>

                <p>"I'll do anything," he said. And I believe he would. I don't think he ever gave up until I drove away without him. He had the dream I've had all my life, and there is no cure.</p>

                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>My wife married a man; I saw no reason why she should inherit a baby.</p>
                <p>When I face the desolate impossibility of writing five hundred pages a sick sense of failure falls on me and I know I can never do it. This happens every time. Then gradually I write one page and then another.</p>
                <p>For how can one know color in perpetual green, and what good is warmth without cold to give it sweetness?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>I remember an old Arab in North Africa, a man whose hands had never felt water. He gave me mint tea in a glass so coated with use that it was opaque, but he handed me companionship, and the tea was wonderful because of it. And without any protection my teeth didn't fall out, nor did running sores develop. I began to formulate a new law describing the relationship of protection to despondency. A sad soul can kill you quicker, far quicker, than a germ.</p>
                <p>It is not unlike me that in heading toward the West I should travel east. That has always been my tendency.</p>
                <p>If the bomb should fall and wipe out every living thing except Miss Brace, George would be happy. That's the way he would design a world if it were up to him.</p>
                <p></p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>...everything in the world must have design or the human mind rejects it. But in addition it must have purpose or the human conscience shies away from it.</p>
                <p>Those people might have been murderers, sadists, brutes, ugly apish subhumans for all I knew, but I found myself thinking, "What charming people, what flair, how beautiful they are. How I wish I knew them." And all based on the delicious smell of soup.</p>
                <p>This prophecy is underwritten by the tendency of the rich to do this already. Where the rich lead, the poor will follow, or try to.</p>
                <p>It is very strange that when you set a goal for yourself, it is hard not to hold toward it even if it is inconvenient and not even desirable.</p>
                <p>So much there is to see, but our morning eyes describe a different world than do our afternoon eyes, and surely our wearied evening eyes can report only a weary evening world.</p>
                <p>When he was finally satisfied and thanked, he got out and slammed the door, but such is my social cowardice that I actually did turn around, knowing he would be watching out the window.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>Before I went to sleep I went over all the things I wished I had said to that immigration man, and some of them were incredibly clever and cutting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>It is the nature of a man as he grows older, a small bridge in time, to protest against change, particularly change for the better.</p>
                <p>Perhaps my greatest wisdom is the knowledge that I do not know. The sad ones are those who waste their energy in trying to hold it back, for they can only feel bitterness in loss and no joy in gain.</p>

                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>I wonder why it is that when I plan a route too carefully it goes to pieces, whereas if I blunder along in blissful ignorance aimed in a fancied direction I get through with no trouble.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>Then it occurred to me that the delicate shades of feeling, of reaction, are the result of communication, and without such communication they tend to disappear.</p>
                <p>Here, Charley, I give you a warning, should you be drawn to generalities. If this people has so atrophied its taste buds as to find tasteless food not only acceptable but desirable, what of the emotional life of the nation? Do they find their emotional fare so bland that it must be spiced with sex and sadism through the medium of the paperback? And if this is so, why are there no condiments save ketchup and mustard to enhance their foods?</p>
                <p>"You think then we might be using the Russians as an outlet for something else, for other things." <br>"I didn't think that at all, sir, but I bet I'm going to. Why, I remember when people took everything out on Mr. Roosevelt. Andy Larsen got red in the face about Roosevelt one time when his hens got the croup. Yes, sir," he said with growing enthusiasm, "those Russians got quite a load to carry. Man has a fight with his wife, he belts the Russians." <br>"Maybe everybody needs Russians. I'll bet even in Russia they need Russians. Maybe they call it Americans."</p>
                <p>There must be in everyone a sense of proper and civil timing, for I had just resolved to speak to my neighbor, in fact had just stood up to move toward him, when he strolled toward me.</p>
                <p>He whirled his plastic glass in his hand and regarded the rinse of whisky left in it, a gesture often designed to draw emptiness to the attention of a host. I uncorked the bottle. <br>"No," he said. "No more for me. I learned long ago that the most important and valuable of acting techniques is the exit." <br>"But I'd like to ask more questions." <br>"All the more reason for the exit." He drained the last drop. "Keep them asking," he said, "and exit clean and sharp. Thank you and good afternoon."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>"Listen to me, dog. I have a strong impulse to stay amounting to celestial command. If I should overcome it and go and a great snow should close in on us, I would recognize it as a warning disregarded. If we stay and a big snow should come I would be certain I had a pipeline to prophecy." <br>Charley sneezed and paced restlessly. "All right, <em>mon cur</em>, let's take your side of it. You want to go on. Suppose we do, and in the night a tree shuld crash down right where we are presently standing. It would be you who have the attention of the gods. And there is always that chance..."</p>
                <p>"...I vote to stay. You vote to go. But being nearer the pinnacle of creation than you, and also president, I cast the deciding vote."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>Frantically I rolled the windows shut and, swinging quickly to the left, grazed the animal, then scuttled on while Charley raved and ranted beside me, describing in detail what he would do to that bear if he could get at him.</p>
                <p>Bears simply brought out the Hyde in my Jekyll-headed dog.</p>
                <p>In the night I heard him whining and yapping, and when I turned on the light his feet were making running gestures and his body jerked and his eyes were wide open, but it was only a night bear. I awakened him and gave him some water. This time he went to sleep and didn't stir all night. In the morning he was still tired. I wonder why we think the thoughts and emotions of animals are simple.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>It is impossible to be in this high spinal country without giving thought to the first men who crossed it, the French explorers, the Lewis and Clark men. We fly it in five hours, drive it in a week, dawdle it as I was doing in a month or six weeks. But Lewis and Clark and their party started in St. Louis in 1804 and returned in 1806. And if we get to thinking we are men, we might remember that in the two and a half years of pushing through wild and unknown country to the Pacific Ocean and then back, only one man died and only one deserted. And we get sick if the milk delivery is late and nearly die of heart failure if there is an elevator strike.</p>
                <p>It wasn't that this veterinary didn't like animals. I think he didn't like himself, and when that is so the subject usually must find an area for dislike outside himself. Else he would have to admit his self-contempt.</p>
                <p>Other guests came and went silently. If one confronted them with "Good evening," they looked a little confused and then responded, "Good evening." It seemed to me that they looked at me for a place to insert a coin.</p>
                <p>We value virtue but do not discuss it. The honest bookkeeper, the faithful wife, the earnest scholar get little of our attention compared to the embezzler, the tramp, the cheat.</p>
                <p>And if ever my faith in the essential saintliness of humans becomes tattered, I shall think of that evil-looking man.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>I stayed two days close to the bodies of the giants, and there were no tripers, no chattering troupes with cameras. There's a cathedral hush here. Perhaps the thick soft bark absorbs sound and creates a silence. The trees rise straight up to zenith; there is no horizon. The dawn comes early and remains dawn until the sun is high. Then the green fernlike foliage so far up strains the sunlight to a green gold and distributes it in shafts or rather in stripes of light and shade. After the sun passes zenith it is afternoon and quickly evening with a whispering dusk as long as was the morning. <br>Thus time and the ordinary divisions of the day are changed. To me dawn and dusk are quiet times, and here in the redwoods nearly the whole of daylight is a quiet time. Birds move in the dim light or flash like sparks through the stripes of sun, but they make little sound. Underfoot is a mattress of needles deposited for over two thousand years. No sound of footsteps can be heard on this thick blanket. To me there's a remote and cloistered feeling here. One holds back speech for fear of disturbing something - what? From my earliest childhood I've felt that something was going on in the groves, something of which I was not a part. And if I had forgotten the feeling, I soon got it back. <br>At night, the darkness is black - only straight up a patch of gray and an occasional star. And there's a breathing in the black, for these huge things that control the day inhabit the night are living things and have presence, and perhaps feeling, and, somewhere in deep-down perception, perhaps communication. I have had lifelong association with these things. (Odd that the word "trees" does not apply.) I can accept them and their power and their age because I was early exposed to them. On the other hand, people lacking such experience begin to have a feeling of uneasiness here, of danger, of being shut in, enclosed and overwhelmed. It is not only the size of these redwoods but their strangeness that frightens them. And why not? For these are the last remaining members of a race that flourished over four continents as far back in geologic time as the upper Jurassic period. Fossils of these ancients have been found dating from the Cretaceous era while in the Eocene and Miocene they were spread over England and Europe and America. And then the glaciers moved down and wiped the Titans out beyond recovery. And only these few are left - a stunning memory of what the world was like once long ago. Can it be that we do not love to be reminded that we are very yound and callow in a world that was old when we came into it? And could there be a strong resistance to the certainty that a living world will continue its stately way when we no longer inhabit it?</p>

                <p>If I were to prepare one immaculately inspected generality it would be this: For all of our enormous geographic range, for all of our sectionalism, for all of our interwoven breeds drawn from every part of the ethnic world, we are a nation, a new breed. Americans are much more American than they are Northerners, Southerners, Westerners, or Easterners. And descendants of English, Irish, Italian, Jewish, German, Polish are essentially American. This is not patriotic whoop-de-do; it is carefully observed fact. California Chinese, Boston Irish, Wisconsin German, yes and Alabama Negroes, have more in common than they have apart.</p>

                <h1><hr></h1>
                <p>Rarely do two states have the same gasoline tax, and these taxes largely support the building and maintenance of highways. The enormous interstate trucks make use of the roads and by their very weight and speed increase the maintenance costs. Thus the states have weighing stations for trucks where the loads are assessed and taxed. And if there is a differential in gasoline tax, the tanks are measured and the tax applied.</p>

                <p>She has virtually no accent until she talks to a Texan, when she instantly reverts. You would not have to scratch deep to find her origin. She says such words as "yes," "air," "hair," "guess," with two syllables - yayus, ayer, hayer, gayus.</p>
                <p>We have heard them threaten to secede so often that I formed an enthusiastic organization - The American Friends for Texas Secession. This stops the subject cold. They want to be able to secede but they don't want anyone to want them to.</p>
                <p>The power of an attitude is amazing.</p>

                <p>Traveling about, I early learned the difference between an American and the Americans. They are so far apart that they might be opposites.</p>
                <p>When people are engaged in something they are not proud of, they do not welcome witnesses. In fact, they come to believe the witness causes the trouble.</p>

                <p>I tossed about until Charley grew angry with me and told me "Ftt" several times. But Charley doesn't have our problems. He doesn't belong to a species clever enough to split the atom but not clever enough to live in peace with itself. He doesn't even know about race, nor is he concerned with his sisters' marriage. It's quite the opposite. Once Charley fell in love with a dachshund, a romance racially unsuitable, physically ridiculous, and mechanically impossible. But all these problems Charley ignored. He loved deeply and tried dogfully. It would be difficult to explain to a dog the good and moral purpose of a thousand humans gathered to curse one tiny human. I've seen a look in dogs' eyes, a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt, and I am convinced that basically dogs think humans are nuts.</p>
                <p>It's true I goaded him, but I couldn't help it. I guess when they're drafting peacemakers they'd better pass me by.</p>

                <p>Who has not known a journey to be over and dead before the traveler returns? The reverse is also true: many a trip continues long after movement in time and space have ceased. I remember a man in Salinas who in his middle years traveled to Honolulu and back, and that journey continued for the rest of his life. We could watch him in his rocking chair on his front porch, his eyes squinted, half-closed, endlessly traveling to Honolulu.</p>
