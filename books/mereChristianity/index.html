                <h2>1</h2>
                <h1>The Law of Human Nature</h1>
                <p>It looks, in fact, very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of Law or Rule of fair play or
                    decent behaviour or morality or whatever you like to call it, about which they really agreed.</p>
                <p>Quarrelling means trying to show that the other man is in the wrong. And there would be no sense in
                    trying to do that unless you and hed had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong are; just
                    as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer had committed a foul unless there was some
                    agreement about the rules of football.</p>
                <p>The idea was that, just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation, and organisms by
                    biological laws, so the creature called man also had his law - with this great difference, that a
                    body could not choose whether it obeyed the law of gravitation or not, but a man could choose either
                    to obey the Law of Human Nature or to disobey it.</p>
                <p>This law was called the Law of Nature because people thought that every one knew it by nature and did
                    not need to be taught it.</p>
                <p>But taking the race as a whole, they thought that the human idea of decent behavior was obvious to
                    every one.</p>
                <p>It seems, then, we are forced to believe in a real Right and Wrong.</p>
                <p>Now if we are agreed about that, I go on to my next point, which is this. None of us are really
                    keeping the Law of Nature.</p>
                <p>These, then, are the two points I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have
                    this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it.
                    Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it.
                    These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live
                    in.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>2</h2>
                <h1>Some Objections</h1>
                <p>Supposing you hear a cry for help from a man in danger. You will probably feel two desires - one a
                    desire to give help (due to your herd instinct), the other a desire to keep out of danger (due to
                    the instinct for self-preservation). But you will find inside you, in addition to these two
                    impulses, a third thing which tells you that you ought to follow the impulse to help, and suppress
                    the impulse to run away. Now this thing that judges between two instincts, that decides which should
                    be encouraged, cannot itself be either of them.</p>
                <p>The Moral Law tells us the tune we have to play: our instincts are merely the keys.</p>
                <p>Strictly speaking, there are no such things as good and bad impulses. Think once again of a piano. It
                    has not got two kinds of notes on it, the 'right' notes and the 'wrong' ones. Every single note is
                    right at one time and wrong at another. The Moral Law is not any one instinct or set of instincts:
                    it is something which makes a kind of tune (the tune we call goodness or right conduct) by directing
                    the instincts.</p>
                <p>The moment you say that one set of moral ideas can be better than another, you are, in fact,
                    measuring them both by a standard, saying that one of them conforms to that standard more nearly
                    than the other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>3</h2>
                <h1>The Reality of the Law</h1>
                <p>You really know, that, given the weather and the soil, the tree could not have been any different.
                    What we, from our point of view, call a 'bad' tree is obeying the laws of its nature just as much as
                    a 'good' one.</p>
                <p>Men ought to be unselfish, ought to be fair. Not that men are unselfish, not that they like being
                    unselfish, but that they ought to be.</p>
                <p>Consequently, this Rule of RIght and Wrong, or Law of Human Nature, or whatever you call it, must
                    somehow or other be a real thing - a thing that is really there, not made up by ourselves.</p>
                <p>It begins to look as if we shall have to admit that there is more than one kind of reality; that, in
                    this particular case, there is something above and beyond the ordinary facts of men's behavior, and
                    yet quite definitely real - a real law, which none of us made, but which we find pressing on us.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>4</h2>
                <h1>What Lies Behind the Law</h1>
                <p>Ever since men were able to think they have been wondering what this universe really is and how it
                    came to be there. And, very roughly, two views have been held. First, there is what is called the
                    materialist view. People who take that view think that matter and space just happen to exist, and
                    always have existed, nobody knows why...The other view is the religious view. According to it, what
                    is behind the universe is more like a mind than it is like anything else we know. That is to say, it
                    is conscious, and has purposes, and prefers one thing to another.</p>
                <p>Wherever there have been thinking men both views turn up. And note this too. You cannot find out
                    which view is the right one by science in the ordinary sense. Science works by experiments. It
                    watches how things behave. Every scientific statement in the long run, however complicated it looks,
                    really means something like, 'I pointed the telescope to such and such a part of the sky at 2:20
                    a.m. on January 15th and saw so-and-so,' or, 'I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to
                    such-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so.'</p>
                <p>But why anything comes to be there at all, and whether there is anything behind the things science
                    observes - something of a different kind - this is not a scientific question. If there is 'Something
                    Behind', then either it will have to remain altogether unknown to men or else make itself known in
                    some different way. The statement that there is any such thing, and the statement that there is no
                    such thing, are neither of them statements that science can make.</p>
                <p>We want to know whether the universe simply happens to be what it is for no reason or whether there
                    is a power behind it that makes it what it is. Since that power, if it exists, would be not one of
                    the observed facts but a reality which makes them, no mere observation of the facts can find it.</p>
                <p>The only way in which we could expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or
                    a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is just what we do find inside
                    ourselves.</p>
                <p>The only packet I am allowed to open is Man. When I do, especially when I open that particular man
                    called Myself, I find that I do not exist on my own, that I am under a law; that somebody or
                    something wants me to behave in a certain way.</p>
                <p>Do not think I am going faster than I really am. I am not yet within a hundred miles of the God of
                    Christian theology. All I have got to is a Something which is directing the universe, and which
                    appears in me as a law urging me to do right and making me feel responsible and uncomfortable when I
                    do wrong.</p>

                <h1>We Have Cause to be Uneasy</h1>
                <p>There is nothing progressive about being pig headed and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if
                    you look at the present state of the world, it is pretty plain that humanity has been making some
                    big mistake. We are on the wrong road. And if that is so, we must go back. Going back is the
                    quickest way on.</p>
                <p>When I chose to get to my real subject in this roundabout way, I was not trying to play any kind of
                    trick on you. I had a different reason. My reason was that Christianity simply does not make sense
                    until you have faced the sort of facts I have been describing. Christianity tells people to repent
                    and promises them forgiveness. It therefore has nothing (as far as I know) to say to people who do
                    not know they have done anything to repent of and who do not feel that they need any forgiveness. It
                    is after you have realized that there is a real Moral Law, and a Power behind the law, and that you
                    have broken that law and put yourself wrong with that Power - it is after all this, and not a moment
                    sooner, that Christianity begins to talk.</p>
                <p>All I am doing is to ask people to face the facts - to understand the questions which Christianity
                    claims to answer.</p>

                <h2>1</h2>
                <h1>The Rival Conceptions of God</h1>
                <p>If you are a Christian you do not have to believe that all the other religions are simply wrong all
                    through. If you are an atheist you do have to believe that the main point in all the religions of
                    the whole world is simply one huge mistake. If you are a Christian, you are free to think that all
                    those religions, even the queerest ones, contain at least some hint of the truth.</p>
                <p>The first of these views - the one that thinks God beyond good and evil - is called Pantheism. It was
                    held by the great Prussian philosopher Hegel and, as far as I can understand them, by the Hindus.
                    The other view is held by Jews, Mohammedans and Christians.</p>
                <p>Pantheists usually believe that God, so to speak, animates the universe as you animate your body:
                    that the universe almost <em>is</em> God, so that if it did not exist He would not exist either, and
                    anything you find in the universe is a part of God. The Christian idea is quite different. They
                    think God invented and made the universe - like a man making a picture or composing a tune.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>2</h2>
                <h1>The Invasion</h1>
                <p>If we ask for something more than simplicity, it is silly then to complain that the something more is
                    not simple.</p>
                <p>When you try to explain the Christian doctrine as it is really held by an instructed adult, they then
                    complain that you are making their heads turn round and that it is all too complicated and that if
                    there really were a God they are sure He would have made 'religion' simple, because simplicity is so
                    beautiful, etc.</p>
                <p>So let us leave behind all these boys' philosophies - these over-simple answers. The problem is not
                    simple and the answer is not going to be simple either.</p>
                <p>There are only two views that face all the facts. One is the Christian view that this is a good world
                    that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been. The other is the
                    view called Dualism. Dualism means the belief that there are two eual and independent powers at the
                    back of everything, one of them good and the other bad, and that this universe is the battlefield in
                    which they fight out an endless war. I personally think that next to Christianity Dualism is the
                    manliest and most sensible creed on the market. But it has a catch in it. <br>The tow powers, or
                    spirits, or gods - the good one and the bad one - are supposed to be quite independent...Each
                    presumably thinks it is good and thinks the other bad. One of them likes hatred and cruelty, the
                    other likes alove and mercy, and each backs its own view. Now what do we mean when we call one of
                    them the Good Power and the other the Bad Power? Either we are merely saying that we happen to
                    prefer the one to the other - like preferring beer to cider - or else we are saying that, whatever
                    the two powers think about it, and whichever we humans, at the moment, happen to like, one of them
                    is actually wrong, actually mistaken, it regarding itself as good.</p>
                <p>But the moment you say that, you are putting into the universe a third thing in addition to the two
                    Powers: some law or standard or rule of good which one of the powers conforms to and the other fails
                    to conform to. But since the two powers are judged by this standars, then this standard, or the
                    Being who made this standard, is farther back and higher up than either of them, and He will be the
                    real God. In fact, what we meant by calling them good and bad turns out to be that one of them is in
                    a right relation to the real ultimate God and the other in a wrong relation to Him.</p>
                <p>I do not mean, of course, that the people who do this are not desperately wicked. I do mean that
                    wickedness, when you examine it, turns out to be the pursuit of some good in the wrong way. You can
                    be good for the mere sake of goodness: you cannot be bad for the mere sake of badness.</p>
                <p>If follows that this Bad Power, who is supposed to be on an equal footing with the Good Power, and to
                    love badness in the same way as the Good Power loves goodness, is a mere bogy. In order to be bad he
                    must have good things to want and then to pursue in the wrong way: he must have impulses which were
                    originally good in order to be able to pervert them.</p>
                <p>Put it more simply still. To be bad, he must exist and have intelligence and will. But existence,
                    intelligence and will are in themeslves good. Therefore he must be getting them from the Good Power:
                    even to be bad he must borrow or steal from his opponent. And do you now begin to see why
                    Christianity has always said that the devil is a fallen angel? That is not a mere story for the
                    children. It is a real recognition of the fact that evil is a parasite, not an original thing. The
                    powers which enable evil to carry on are powers given it by goodness. All the things which enable a
                    bad man to be effectively bad are in themeselves good things - resolution, cleverness, good looks,
                    existence itself. That is why Dualism, in a strict sense, will not work.</p>
                <p>Christianity agrees with Dualism that this universe is at war. But it does not think this is a war
                    between independent powers. It thinks it is a civil war, a rebellion, and that we are living in a
                    part of the universe occupied by the rebel.</p>
                <p>Enemy-occupied territory - that is what this world is.</p>

                <h2>3</h2>
                <h1>The Shocking Alternative</h1>
                <p>Is this state of affairs in accordance with God's will, or not? If it is, He is a strange God, you
                    will say: and if it is not, how can anything happen contrary to the will of a being with absolute
                    power?</p>
                <p>It may be quite sensible for a mother to say to the children, "I'm not going to go and make you tidy
                    the schoolroom every night. You've got to learn to keep it tidy on your own." Then she goes up one
                    night and finds the Teddy bear and the ink and the French Grammar all lying in the grate. That is
                    against her will. She would prefer the children to be tidy. But on the other hand, it is her will
                    which has left the children free to be untidy.</p>
                <p>You make a thing voluntary and then half the people do not do it. That is not what you willed, but
                    your will has made it possible.</p>
                <p>Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong; I
                    cannot. If a thing is free to be good it is also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil
                    possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible,
                    is also the only thing that makes possible and love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of
                    automata - of creatures that worked like machines - would hardly be worth creating.</p>
                <p>When we have understood about free will, we shall see how silly it is to ask, as somebody once asked
                    me: "Why did God make a creature of such rotten stuff that it went wrong?" The better stuff a
                    creature is made of - the cleverer and stronger and freer it is - then the better it will be if it
                    goes right, but also the worse it will be if it goes wrong.</p>
                <p>The moment you have a self at all, there is a possibility of putting yourself first - wanting to be
                    the centre - wanting to be God, in fact. That was the sin of Satan: and that was the sin he taught
                    the human race.</p>
                <p>What Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they could "be like gods" -
                    could set up on their own as if they had created themselves - be their own masters - invent some
                    sort of happiness for themselves outside God, apart from God. And out of that hopeless attempt has
                    come nearly all that we call human history - money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes,
                    empires, slavery - the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will
                    make him happy.</p>
                <p>I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him:
                    "I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God." That
                    is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said
                    would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on a level with the man who says
                    he is a peached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell...Either this man was, and is, the Son
                    of God: or else a madman or something worse.</p>

                <h1>The Perfect Penitent</h1>
                <p>The thing itself cannot be pictured, it can only be expressed mathematically. We are in the same boat
                    here. We believe that the death of Christ is just that point in history at which something
                    absolutely unimaginable from outside shows through into our own world. And if we cannot picture even
                    the atoms of which our own world is built, of course we are not going to be able to picture this.
                    Indeed, if we found that we could fully understand it, that very fact would show it was not what it
                    professes to be - the inconceivable, the uncreated, the thing from beyond nature, striking down into
                    nature like lightning.</p>
                <p>A man can eat his dinner without understanding exactly how food nourishes him. A man can accept what
                    Christ has done without knowing how it works: indeed, he certainly would not know how it works until
                    he has accepted it.</p>
                <p>We are told that Christ was killed for us, that His death has washed out our sins, and that by dying
                    He disabled death itself. That is the formula. That is Christianity. That is what has to be
                    believed. Any theories we build up as to how Christ's death did all this are, in my view, quite
                    secondary: mere plans or diagrams to be left alone if they do not help us, and, even if they do help
                    us, not to be confused with the thing itself.</p>
                <p>In other words, fallen man is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: he is a rebel
                    who must lay down his arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realising
                    that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground
                    floor - that is the only way out of our 'hole'. This process of surrender - this movement full speed
                    astern - is what Christians call repentance. Now repentance is no fun at all. It is something much
                    harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we
                    have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing part of yourself,
                    undergoing a kind of death. In fact, it needs a good man to repent. And here comes the catch. Only a
                    bad person needs to repent: only a good person can repent perfectly. The worse you are the more you
                    need it and the less you can do it. The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect
                    person - and he would not need it.</p>
                <p>But supposing God became a man - suppose our human nature which can suffer and die was amalgamated
                    with God's nature in one person - then that person could help us. He could surrender His will, and
                    suffer and die, because He was man; and He could do it perfectly because He was God.</p>
                <p>Our attempts at this dying will succeed only if we men share in God's dying, just as our thinking can
                    succeed only because it is a drop out of the ocean of His intelligence: but we cannot share God's
                    dying unless God dies, and He cannot die except by being a man. That is the sense in which He pays
                    our debt, and suffers for us what He Himself need not suffer at all.</p>
                <p>But remember this is only one more picture. Do not mistake it for the thing itself: and if it does
                    not help you, drop it.</p>

                <h1>The Practical Conclusion</h1>
                <p>People often ask when the next step in evolution - the step to something beyond man - will happen.
                    But in the Christian view, it has happened already. In Christ a new kind of man appeared: and the
                    new kind of life which began in Him is to be put into us.</p>
                <p>There are three things that spread the Christ-life to us: baptism, belief, and that mysterious action
                    which different Christians call by different names - Holy Communion, the Mass, the Lord's Supper.
                </p>
                <p>The ordinary man believes in the Solar System, atoms, evolution, and the circulation of the blood on
                    authority - because the scientists say so. Every historical statement in the world is believed on
                    authority. None of us has seen the Norman Conquest or the defeat of the Armada. None of us could
                    prove them by pure logic as you prove a thing in mathematics. We believe them simply because people
                    who did see them have left writings that tell us about them: in fact, on authority.</p>
                <p>In the same way a Christian can lose the Christ-life which has been put into him, and he has to make
                    efforts to keep it. But even the best Christian that ever lived is not acting on his own steam - he
                    is only nourishing or protecting a life he could never have acquired by his own efforts.</p>
                <p>A live body is not one that never gets hurt, but one that can to some extent repair itself. In the
                    same way a Christian is not a man who never goes wrong, but a man who is enabled to repend and pick
                    himself up and begin over again after each stumble - because the Christ-life is inside him,
                    repairing him all the time, enabling him to repeat (in some degree) the kind of voluntary death
                    which Christ Himself carried out.</p>
                <p>But the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him. He does not think
                    God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us, just as
                    the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because
                    the sun shines on it.</p>
                <p>When they speak of being 'in Christ' or of Christ being 'in them', this is not simply a way of saying
                    that they are thinking about Christ or copying Him. They mean that Christ is actually operating
                    through them; that the whole mass of Christians are the physical organism through which Christ acts
                    - that we are His fingers and muscles, the cells of His body.</p>
                <p>Here is another thing that used to puzzle me. Is it not frightfully unfair that this new life should
                    be confined to people who have heard of Christ and been able to believe in Him? But the truth is God
                    has not told us what His arrangements about the other people are. We do know that no man can be
                    saved except through Christ; we do not know that only those who know Him can be saved through Him.
                    But in the meantime, if you are worried about the people outside, the most unreasonable thing you
                    can do is to remain outside yourself.</p>
                <p>Another possible objection is this. Why is God landing in this enemy-occupied world in disguise and
                    starting a sort of secret society to undermine the devil? Why is He not landing in force, invading
                    it? Is it that He is not strong enough? Well, Christians think He is going to land in force; we do
                    not know when. But we can guess why He is delaying. He wants to give us the chance of joining His
                    side freely. I do not suppose you and I would have thought much of a Frenchman who waited till the
                    Allies were marching into Germany and then announced he was on our side. God will invade. But I
                    wonder whether people who ask God to interfere openly and directly in our world quite realise what
                    it will be like when He does. When that happens, it is the end of the world. When the author walks
                    on to the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right: but what is the good of saying
                    you are on His side then, when you see the whole natural universe melting away like a dream and
                    something else - something it never entered your head to conceive - comes crashing in; something so
                    beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For
                    this time it will be God without disguise; something so overwhelming that it will strike either
                    irresistible love or irresistible horror into every creature. It will be too late then to choose
                    your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up.
                    That will not be the time for choosing: it will be the time when we discover which side we really
                    have chosen, whether we realised it before or not. Now, todya, this moment, is our chance to choose
                    the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last for ever. We must take
                    it or leave it.</p>

                <h2>1</h2>
                <h1>The Three Parts of Morality</h1>
                <p>Perfect behaviour may be as unattainable as perfect gear-changing when we drive; but it is a
                    necessary ideal prescribed for all men by the very nature of the human machine just as perfect
                    gear-changing is an ideal prescribed for all drivers by the very nature of cars. And it would be
                    even more dangerous to think of oneself as a person "of high ideals" because one is trying to tell
                    no lies at all (instead of only a few lies) or never to commit adultery (instead of committing it
                    only seldom) or not to be a bully (instead of being only a moderate bully.)</p>
                <p>By talking about rules and obedience instead of "ideals" and "idealism" we help to remind ourselves
                    of these facts.</p>
                <p>You can get the idea ;lain if you think of us as a fleet of ships sailing in formation. The voyage
                    will be a success only, in the first place, if the ships do not collide and get in one another's
                    way; and, secondly, if each ship is seaworthy and has her engines in good order. As a matter of
                    fact, you cannot have either of these two things without the other.</p>
                <p>Or, if you like, think of humanity as a band playing a tune. To get a good result, you need two
                    things. Each player's individual instrument must be in tune and also each must come in at the right
                    moment so as to combine with all the others.</p>
                <p>But there is one thing we have not yet taken into account. We have not asked where the fleet is
                    trying to get to, or what piece of music the band is trying to play.</p>
                <p>Morality, then, seems to be concerned with three things. Firstly, with fair play and harmony between
                    individuals. Secondly, with what might be called tidying up or harmonising the things inside each
                    individual. Thirdly, with the general purpose of human life as a whole: what man was made for: what
                    course the whole fleet ought to be on: what tune the conductor of the band wants it to play.</p>
                <p>Almost all people at all times have agreed (in theory) that human beings ought to be honest and kind
                    and helpful to one another. But though it is natural to begin with all that, if our thinking about
                    morality stops there, we might just as well not have thought at all. Unless we go on to the second
                    thing - the tidying up inside each human being - we are only deceiving ourselves.</p>
                <p>I do not mean for a moment that we ought not to think, and think hard, about improvements in our
                    social and economic system. What I do mean is that all that thinking will be mere moonshine unless
                    we realise that nothing but the courage and unselfishness of individuals is ever going to make any
                    system work properly.</p>
                <p>You cannot make men good by law: and without good men you cannot have a good society. That is why we
                    must go on to think of the second thing: of morality inside the individual.</p>
                <p>If somebody else made me, for his own purposes, then I shall have a lot of duties which I should not
                    have if I simply belonged to myself.</p>
                <p>If individuals live only seventy years, then a state, or a nation, or a civilisation, which may last
                    for a thousand years, is more important than an individual. But if Christianity is true, then the
                    individual is not only more important but incomparably more important, for he is everlasting and the
                    life of a state or a civilisation, compared with his, is only a moment.</p>
                <p>It seems, then, that if we are to think about morality, we must think of all three departments:
                    relations between man and man: thing inside each man: and relations between man and the power that
                    made him.</p>

                <h2>2</h2>
                <h1>The 'Cardinal Virtues'</h1>
                <p>According to this longer scheme there are seven "virtues". Four of them called "Cardinal" virtues,
                    and the remaining three are called "Theological" virtues. The "Cardinal" ones are those which all
                    civilised people recognise: the "Theological" are those which, as a rule, only Christians know
                    about. I shall deal with the Theological ones later on: at present I am talking about the four
                    Cardinal virtues.</p>
                <p>The are <em>prudence, temperance, justice</em> and <em>fortitude.</em></p>
                <p>Prudence means practical common sense, taking the trouble to think out what you are doing and what is
                    likely to come of it.</p>
                    <p>...as St Paul points out, Christ never meant that we were to remain children in <em>intelligence</em>: on the contrary. He told us to be not only "as harmless as doves", but also "as wise as serpents". He wants a child's heart, but a grown-up's head. He wants us to be simple, single-minded, affectionate, and teachable, as good children are; but He also wants every bit of intelligence we have to be alert at its job, and in first-class fighting trim. The fact that you are giving money to a charity does not mean that you need not try to find out whether that charity is a fraud or not.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, quite true that God will not love you any the less, or have less use for you, if you happen to have been born with a very second-rate brain. He has room for people with very little sense, but He wants every one to use what sense they have.</p>
                    <p>If you are thinking ob becoming a Christian, I warn you, you are embarking on something which is going to take the whole of you, brains and all. But, fortunately, it works the other way round. Anyone who is honestly trying to be a Christian will soon find his intelligence being sharpened: one of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that Christianity is an education itself.</p>
                    <p>Temperance is, unfortunately, one of those words that has changed its meaning.</p>
                    <p>Temperance referred not specially to drink, but to all pleasures; and it meant not abstaining, but going the right length and no further. It is a mistake to think that Christians ought all to be teetotallers; Mohammedanism, not Christianity, is the teetotal religion. Of course it may be the duty of a particular Christian, or of any Christian, at a particular time, to abstain from strong drink, either because he is the sort of man who cannot drink at all withought drinking too much, or because he is with people who are inclined to drunkenness and must not encourage them by drinking himself.</p>
                    <p>One of the marks of a certain type of bad man is that he cannot give up a thing himself without wanting every one else to give it up. That is not the Christian way.</p>
                    <p>A man who makes his golf or his motor-bicycle the centre of his life, or a woman who devotes all her thoughts to clothes or bridge or her dog, is being just as "intemperate" as someone who gets drunk every evening. Of course, it does not show on the outside so easily: bridge-mania or golf-mania do not make you fall down in the middle of the road. But God is not deceived by externals.</p>
                    <p>Justice means much more than the sort of thing that goes on in law courts. It is the old name for everything we should now call "fairness"; it includes honesty, give and take, truthfulness, keeping promises, and all that side of life. And Fortitude includes both kinds of courage - the kind that faces danger as well as the kind that "sticks it" under pain. "Guts" is perhaps the nearest modern English.</p>
                    <p>In the same way a man who perseveres in doing just actions gets in the end a certain quality of character. Now it is that quality rather than the particular actions which we mean when we talk of a "virtue".</p>
                    <p>This distinction is important for the following reason. If we thought only of the particular actions we might encourage three wrong ideas.</p>
                    <p class="subPara">(1) We might think that, provided you did the right thing, it did not matter how or why you did it - whether you did it willingly or unwillingly, sulkily or cheerfully, through fear of public opinion or for its own sake. But the truth is that right actions done for the wrong reason do not help to build the internal quality or character called a "virtue", and it is this quality or character that really matters.</p>
                    <p class="subPara">(2) We might think that God wanted simply obedience to a set of rules: whereas He really wants people of a particular sort.</p>
                    <p class="subPara">(3) We might think that the "virtues" were necessary only for this present life - that in the other world we could stop being just because there is nothing to quarrel about and stop being brave because there is no danger. Now it is quite true that there will probably be no occasion for just or courageous acts in the next world, but there will be every occasion for being the sort of people what we can become only as the result of doing such acts here.</p>

                <h1>Social Morality</h1>
                <p>As Dr Johnson said, "People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed." The real job of every moral teacher is to keep on bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple principles which we are all so anxious not to see; like bringing a horse back and back to the fence it has refused to jump or bringing a child back and back to the bit in its lesson that it wants to shirk.</p>
                <p>When it tells you to feed the hungry it does not give you lessons in cookery. When it tells you to read the Scriptures it does not give you lessons in Hebrew and Greek, or even in English grammar. It was never intended to replace or supersede the ordinary human arts and sciences: it is rather a director which will set them all to the right jobs, and a source of energy which will give them all new life, if only they will put themselves at its disposal.</p>
                <p>You will find this again and again about anything that is really Christian: every one is attracted by bits of it and wants to pick out those bits and leave the rest. That is why we do not get much further: and that is why people who are fighting for quite opposite things can both say they are fighting for Christianity.</p>
                <p>Charity - giving to the poor - is an essential part of Christian morality: in the frightening parable of the sheep and the goats it seems to be the point on which everything turns.</p>
                <p>I am afraid the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare. In other words, if our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc., is up to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too little. If our charities do not at all pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought to be things we should like to do and cannot do because our charities expenditure excludes them.</p>
                <p>For many of us the great obstacle to charity lies not in our luxurious living or desire for more money, but in our fear - fear of insecurity.</p>
                <p>Sometimes our pride also hinders our charity; we are tempted to spend more than we ought on the showy forms of generosity (tipping, hospitality) and less than we ought on those who really need our help.</p>
                <p>Most of us are not really approaching the subject in order to find out what Christianity says: we are approaching it in the hope of finding support from Christianity for the views of our own party. We are looking for an ally where we are offered either a Master or - a Judge.</p>
                <p>I may repeat "Do as you would be done by" till I am black in the face, but I cannot really carry it out till I love my neighbour as myself: and I cannot learn to love my neighbour as myself till I learn to love God: and I cannot learn to love God except by learning to obey Him. And so, as I warned you, we are driven on to something more inward - driven on from social matters to religious matters. For the longest way round is the shortest way home.</p>

                <h1>Morality and Psychoanalysis</h1>
                <p>When a man makes a moral choice two things are involved. One is the act of choosing. The other is the various feelings, impulses and so on which his psychological outfit presents him with, and which are the raw material of his choice. Now this raw material may be of two kinds. Either it may be what we would call normal: it may consist of the sort of feelings that are common to all men. Or else it may consist of quite unnatural feelings due to things that have gone wrong in his subconscious. Thus fear of things that are really dangerous would be an example of the first kind: an irrational fear of cats or spiders would be an example of the second kind.</p>
                <p>Now what psychoanalysis undertakes to do is to remove the abnormal feelings, that is, to give the man better raw material for his acts of choice; morality is concerned with the acts of choice themselves.</p>
                <p>However much you improve the man's raw material, you have still got something else: the real, free choice of the man, on the material presented to him, either to put his own advantage first or to put it last. And this free choice is the only thing that morality is concerned with.</p>
                <p>The bad psychological material is not a sin but a disease. It does not need to be repented of, but to be cured.</p>
                <p>Human beings judge one another by their external actions. God judges them by their moral choices.</p>
                <p>That is why Christians are told not to judge. We see only the results which a man's choices make out of his raw material. But God does not judge him on the raw material at all, but on what he has done with it.</p>
                <p>People often think of Christian morality as a kind of bargain in which God says, 'If you keep a lot of rules I'll reward you, and if you don't I'll do the other thing.'</p>
                <p>I would much rather say that every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before.</p>
                <p>To be the one kind of creature is heaven: that is, it is joy and peace and knowledge and power. To be the other means madness, horror, idiocy, rage, impotence, and eternal loneliness. Each of us at each moment is progressing to the one state or the other.</p>

                <h1>Sexual Morality</h1>
                <p>We must now consider Christian morality as regards sex, what Christians call the virtue of chastity. The Christian rule of chastity must not be confused with the social rule of 'modesty' (in one sense of that word); i.e. propriety, or decency.</p>
                <p>Thus, while the rule of chastity is the same for all Christians at all times, the rule of propriety changes.</p>
                <p>When people break the rule of propriety current in their own time and place, if they do so in order to excite lust in themselves or others, then they are offending against chastity. But if they break it through ignorance or carelessness they are guilty only of bad manners.</p>
                <p>While this confusion lasts I think that old, or old-fashioned, people should be very careful not to assume that young or 'emancipated' people are corrupt whenever they are (by the old standard) improper; and, in return, that young people should not call their elders prudes or puritans because they do not easily adopt the new standard.</p>
                <p>But if a healthy young man indulged his sexual appetite whenever he felt inclined, and if each act produced a baby, then in ten years he might easily populate a small village. This appetite is in ludicrous and preposterous excess of its function.</p>
                <p>There is nothing to be ashamed of in enjoying your food: there would be everything to be ashamed of if half the world made food the main interest of their lives and spent their time looking at pictures of food and dribbling and smacking their lips.</p>
                <p>God knows our situation; He will not judge us as if we had no difficulties to overcome. What matters is the sincerity and perseverance of our will to overcome them.</p>
                <p>Those who really wish for help will get it; but for many modern people even the wish is difficult. It is easy to think that we want something when we do not really want it.</p>
                <p>In the first place our warped natures, the devils hwo tempt us, and all the contemporary propaganda for lust, combine to make us feel that the desires we are resisting are so 'natural', so 'healthy', and so reasonable, that it is almost perverse and abnormal to resist them. Poster after poster, film after film, novel after novel, associate the idea of sexual indulgence with the ideas of health, normality, youth, frankness, and good humour. Now this association is a lie. Like all powerful lies, it is based on a truth - the truth, acknowledged above, that sex in itself (apart from the excesses and obsessions that have grown round it) is 'normal' and 'healthy', and all the rest of it. The lie consists in the suggestion that any sexual act to which you are tempted at the moment is also healthy and normal.</p>
                <p>Surrender to all our desires obviously leads to impotence, disease, jealousies, lies, concealment, and everything that is the reverse of health, good humour, and frankness.</p>
                <p>After each failure, ask forgiveness, pick yourself up, and try again. Very often what God first helps us towards is not the virtue itself but just this power of always trying again.</p>
                <p>Virtue - even attempted virtue - brings light; indulgence brings fog.</p>
                <p>Finally, though I have had to speak at some length about sex, I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that the centre of Christian morality is not here. If anyone thinks that Christians regard unchastity as the supreme vice, he is quite wrong.</p>

                <h1>Christian Marriage</h1>
                <p>The Christian attitude does not mean that there is anything wrong about sexual pleasure, any more than about the pleasure of eating. It means that you must not isolate that pleasure and try to get it by itself, any more than you ought to try to get the pleasures of taste without swallowing and digesting, by chewing things and spitting them out again.</p>
                <p>The idea that 'bing in love' is the only reason for remaining married really leaves no room for marriage as a contract or promise at all. If love is the whole thing, then the promise can add nothing; and if it adds nothing, then it should not be made.</p>
                <p>And, of course, the promise, made when I am in love and because I am in love, to be true to the beloved as long as I live, commits me to being true even if I cease to be in love. A promise must be about things that I can do, about actions: no one can promise to go on feeling in a certain way. He might as well promise never to have a headache or always to feel hungry. But what, it may be asked, is the use of keeping two people together if they are no longer in love? There are several sound, social reasons; to provide a home for their children.</p>
                <p>...love is the great conqueror of lust.</p>
                <p>Being in love is a good thing, but it is not the best thing. There are many things below it, but there are also things above it. You cannot make it the basis of a whole life. It is a noble feeling, but it is still a feeling.</p>
                <p>And in fact, whatever people say, the state called 'bing in love' usually does not last. If the old fairy-tale ending 'They lived happily ever after' is taken to mean 'They felt for the next fifty years exactly as they felt the day before they were married', then is says what probably never was nor ever would be true, and would be highly undesirable if it were.</p>
                <p>But, of course, ceasing to be 'in love' need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense - love as distinct from 'being in love' - is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by th will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God. They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other; as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself.</p>
                <p>People get from books the idea that if you have married the right person you may expect to go on 'being in love' for ever. As a result, when they find they are not, they think this proves they have made a mistake and are entitled to a change - not realising that, when they have changed, the galamour will presently go out of the new love just as it went out of the old one.</p>
                <p>The sort of thrill a boy has at the first idea of flying will not go on when he has joined the R.A.F. and is really learning to fly. The thrill you feel on first seeing some delightful place dies away when you really go to live there. Does this mean it would be better not to learn to fly and not to live in the beautiful place? By no means. In both cases, if you go through with it, the dying away of the first thrill will be compensated for by a quieter and more lasting kind of interest. What is more (and I can hardly find words to tell you how important I think this), it is just the people who are ready to submit to the loss of the thrill and settle down to the sober interest, who are then most likely to meet new thrills in some quite different direction. The man who has learned to fly and become a good pilot will suddenly discover music; the man who has settled down to live in the beauty spot will discover gardening.</p>
                <p>Let the thrill go - let it die away - go on through that period of death into the quieter interest and happiness that follow - and you will find you are living in a world of new thrills all the time.</p>

                <h1>Forgiveness</h1>
                <p>I remember Christian teachers telling me long ago that I must hate a bad man's actions, but not hate the bad man: or, as they would say, hate the sin but not the sinner.</p>
                <p>But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life - namely myself. However much I might dislike my own cowardice or conceit or greed, I went on loving myself.</p>
                <p>Consequently, Christianity does not want us to reduce by one atom the hatred we feel for cruelty and treachery. We ought to hate them. Not one word of what we have said about them needs to be unsaid. But it does want us to hate them in the same way in which we hate things in ourselves: being sorry that the man should have done such things, and hoping, if it is anyway possible, that somehow, sometime, somewhere he can be cured and made human again.</p>
                <p>Does loving your enemy mean not punishing him? No, for loving myself does not mean that I ought not to subject myself to punishment - even to death.</p>
                <p>It is, therefore, in my opinion, perfectly right for a Christian judge to sentence a man to death or a Christian soldier to kill an enemy. I always have thought so, ever since I became a Christian, and long before the war, and I still think so now that we are at peace. It is no good quoting 'Thou shalt not kill.' There are two Greek words: the ordinary word to <em>kill</em> and the word to <em>murder</em>. And when Christ quotes that commandment He uses the <em>murder</em> one in all three accounts, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</p>
                <p>All killing is not murder any more than all sexual intercourse is adultery.</p>
                <p>We may kill if necessary, but we must not hate and enjoy hating. We may punish if necessary, but we must not enjoy it.</p>
                <p>Even while we kill and punish we must try to feel about the enemy as we feel about ourselves - to wish that he were not bad, to hope that he may, in this world or another, be cured: in fact, to wish his good. That is what is meant in the Bible by loving him: wishing his good, not feeling fond of him nor saying he is nice when he is not.</p>
                <p>We have then to go on and apply the rule to all the other selves. Perhaps it makes it easier if we remember that that is how He loves us. Not for any nice, attractive qualities we think we have, but just because we are the things called selves. For really there is nothing else in us to love: creatures like us who actually find hatred such a pleasure that to give it up is like giving up beet or tobacco.</p>

                <h1>The Great Sin</h1>
                <p>There is one vice of which no man in the world is free; which every one in the world loathes when he sees it in someone else; and of which hardly any people, except Christians, ever imagine that they are guilty themselves.</p>
                <p>There is no fault which makes a man more unpopular, and no fault which we are more unconscious of in ourselves. And the more we have it ourselves, the more we dislike it in others.</p>
                <p>The vice I am talking of is Pride or Self-Conceit: and the virtue opposite to it, in Christian morals, is called Humility. You may remember, when I was talking about sexual morality, I warned you that the centre of Christian morals did not lie there. Well, now, we have come to the centre.</p>
                <p>Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.</p>
                <p>In fact, if you want to find out how proud you are the easiest way is to ask yourself, 'How much do I dislike it when other people snub me, or refuse to take any notice of me, or shove their oar in, or patronise me, or show off?' The point is that each person's pride is in competition with every one else's pride.</p>
                <p>Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, or cleverer, or better-looking than others.</p>
                <p>It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest.</p>
                <p>Nearly all those evils in the world which people put down to greed or selfishness are really far more the result of Pride.</p>
                <p>For, of cours, power is what Pride really enjoys: there is nothing makes a man feel so superior to others as being able to move them about like toy soldiers.</p>
                <p>The Christians are right: it is Pride which has been the chief cause of misery in every nation and every family since the world began.</p>
                <p>In God you come up against something which is in every respect immeasurably superior to yourself. Unless you know God as that -and, therefore, know yourself as nothing in comparison - you do not know God at all.</p>
                <p>A proud man is always looking down on things and people: and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.</p>
                <p>Luckily, we have a test. Whenever we find that our religious life is making us feel that we are good - above all, that we are better than someone else - I think we may be sure that we are bing acted on, not by God, but by the devil. The real test of being in the presence of God is, that you either forget about yourself altogether or see yourself as a small, dirty object. It is better to forget about yourself altogether.</p>
                <p>For Pride is spiritual cancer: it eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or even common sense.</p>
                <p>Before leaving this subject I must guard agains some possible misunderstandings:</p>
                <p class="subPara">(1) Pleasure in being praised is not Pride.</p>
                <p class="subPara">The trouble begins when you pass from thinking, 'I have pleased him; all is well,' to thinking, 'What a fine person I must be to have done it.' The more you delight in yourself and the less you delight in the praise, the worse you are becoming.</p>
                <p class="subPara">Of course, it is very right, and often our duty, not to care what people think of us, if we do so for the right reason; namely, because we care so incomparably more what God thinks. But the Proud man has a different reason for not caring. He says 'Why should I care for the applause of that rabble as if their opinion were worth anything? And even if their opinions were of value, am I the sort of man to blush with pleasure at a compliment like some chit of a girl at her first dance? No, I am an integrated, adult personality.</p>
                <p class="subPara">...for, as I said a moment ago, the devil loves 'curing' a small fault by giving you a great one. We must try not to be vain, but we must never call in our Pride to cure our vanity.</p>
                <p class="subPara">(3) The point is, He wants you to know Him: wants to give you Himself. And He and you are two things of such a kind that if you really get into any kind of touch with Him you will, in fact, be humble - delightedly humble, feeling the infinite relief of having for once got rid of all the silly nonsense about your own dignity which has made you restless and unhappy all your life. He is trying to make you humble in order to make this moment possible: trying to take off a lot of silly, ugly, fancy-dress in which we have all got ourselves up and are strutting about like the little idiots we are.</p>
                <p class="subPara">(4) If anyone would like to acquire humility, I can, I think, tell him the first step. The first step is to realise that one is proud.</p>
                <p class="subPara">If you think you are not conceited, it means you are very conceited indeed.</p>

                <h1>Charity</h1>
                <p>I said in an earlier chapter that there were four 'Cardinal' virtues and three 'Theological' virtues. The three Theological ones are Faith, Hope, and Charity.</p>
                <p>Charity means 'Love, in the Christian sense'. But love, in the Christian sense, does not mean an emotion. It is a state not of the feelings but of the will; that state of the will which we have naturally about ourselves, and must learn to have about other people.</p>
                <p>We 'like' or are 'fond of' some people, and not of others. It is important to understand that this natural 'liking' is neither a sin nor a virtue, any more than your likes and dislikes in food are a sin or a virtue. It is just a fact. But, of course, what we do about it is either sinful or virtuous.</p>
                <p>Some people are 'cold' by temperament; that my be a misfortune for them, but it is no more a sin than having bad digestion is a sin; and it does not cut them out from the chance, or excuse them from the duty, of learning charity.</p>
                <p>The rule for all of us is perfectly simple. Do not waste time bothering whether you 'love' your neighbour; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good turn, you will find yourself disliking him less. There is, indeed, one exception. If you do him a good turn, not to please God and obey the law of charity, but to show him what a fine forgiving chap you are, and to put him in your debt, and then sit down to wait for his 'gratitude', you will probably be disappointed.</p>
                <p>The more cruel you are, the more you will hate; and the more you hate, the more cruel you will become - and so on in a vicious circle for ever.</p>
                <p>Good and evil both increase at compund interest.</p>
                <p>They are told they ought to love God. They cannot find any such feeling in themselves. What are they to do? The answer is the same as before. Act as if you did. Do not sit trying to manufacture feelings. Ask yourself, 'If I were sure that I loved God, what would I do?' When you have found the answer, go and do it.</p>

                <h1>Hope</h1>
                <p>If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next.</p>
                <p>Aim at Heaven and you will get earth 'thrown in': aim at earth and you will get neither.</p>
                <p>In the same way, we shall never save civilisation as long as civilisation is our main object. We must learn to want something else even more.</p>
                <p>I think everyone knows what I mean. The wife may be a good wife, and the hotels and scenery may have been excellent, and chemistry may be a very interesting job: but something has evaded us. Now there are two wrong ways of dealing with this fact, and one right one.</p>
                <p class="subPara">(1) The Fool's Way - He puts the blame on the things themselves. He goes on all his life thinking that if only he tried another woman, or went for a more expensive holiday, or whatever it is, then, this time, he really would catch the mysterious something we are all after.</p>
                <p class="subPara">(2) The Way of the Disillusioned 'Sensible Man' - He soon decides that the whole thing was moonshine. 'Of course,' he says, 'one feels like that when one's young. But by the time you get to my age you've given up chasing the rainbow's end.' And so he settles down and learns not to expect too much and represses the part of himself which used, as he would say, 'to cry for the moon'.</p>
                <p class="subPara">(3) The Christian Way - The Christian says, 'Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the mose probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing...</p>
                <p>...I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others to do the same.'</p>
                <p>There is no need to be worried by facetious people who try to make the Christian hope of 'Heaven' ridiculous by saying they do not want 'to spend eternity playing harps'. The answer to such people is that if they cannot understand books written for grown-ups, they should not talk about them. All the scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc.) is, of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible.</p>
                <p>People who take these symbols literally might as well think that when Christ told us to be like doves, He meant that we were to lay eggs.</p>

                <h2>11</h2>
                <h1>Faith</h1>
                <p>In the first sense it means simply Belief - accepting or regarding as true the doctrines of Christianity.</p>
                <p>But what does puzzle people - at least it used to puzzle me - is the fact that Christians regard faith in this sense as a virtue.</p>
                <p>If he were mistaken about the goodness or badness of the evidence that would not mean he was a bad man, but only that he was not very clever. And if he thought the evidence bad but tried to force himself to believe in spite of it, that would be merely stupid.</p>
                <p>Well, I think I still take that view. But what I did not see then - and a good many people do not see still - was this...I was assuming that the human mind is completely ruled by reason. But that is not so.</p>
                <p>In other words, I lose my faith in anaesthetics. It is not reaon that is taking away my faith: on the contrary, my faith is based on reason. It is my imagination and emotions. The battle is between faith and reason on one side and emotion and imagination on the other.</p>
                <p>I am not asking anyone to accept Christianity if his best reasoning tells him that the weight of the evidence is against it. That is not the point at which Faith comes in. But supposing a man's reason once decides that the weight of the evidence is for it.</p>
                <p>There will come a moment when there is bad news, or he is in trouble, or is living among a lot of other people who do not believe it, and all at once his emotions will rise up and carry out a sort of blitz on his belief. Or else there will come a moment when he wants a woman, or wants to tell a lie, or feels very pleased with himself, or sees a chance of making a little money in some way that is not perfectly fair: some moment, in fact, at which it would be very convenient if Christianity were not true.</p>
                <p>I am not talking of moments at which any real new reasons against Christianity turn up. Those have to be faced and that is a different matter. I am talking about moments when a mere mood rises up against it.</p>
                <p>Now Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods.</p>
                <p>This rebellion of your moods against your real self is going to come anyway. That is why Faith is such a necessary virtue: unless you teach your moods 'where they get off', you can never be either a sound Christian or even a sound atheist, but just a creature dithering to and fro, with its beliefs really dependent on the weather and the state of its digestion. Consequently one must train the habit of Faith.</p>
                <p>That is why daily prayers and religious readings and church-going are necessary parts of the Christian life. We have to be continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any other will automatically remain alive in the mind. It must be fed.</p>
                <p>No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good.</p>
                <p>Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is.</p>
                <p>We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means - the only complete realist...The main thing we learn from a serious attempt to practise the Christian virtues is that we fail.</p>

                <h1>Faith</h1>
                <p>Whenever you find any statement in Christian writings which you can make nothing of, do not worry. Leave it alone. There will come a day, perhaps years later, when you suddenly see what it meant.</p>
                <p>I said just now that the question of Faith in this sense arises after a man has tried his level best to practise the Christian virtues, and found that he fails, and seen that even if he could he would only be giving back to God what was already God's own. In other words, he discovers his bankruptcy. Now, once again, what God cares about is not exactly our actions. What he cares about is that we should be creatures of a certain kind or quality - the kind of creatures He intended us to be - creatures related to Himself in a certain way.</p>
                <p>And as long as a man is thinking of God as an examiner who has set him a sort of paper to do, or as the opposite party in a sort of bargain - as long as he is thinking of claims and counter-claims between himself and God - he is not yet in the right relation to Him. He is misunderstanding what he is and what God is. And he cannot get into the right relation until he has discovered the fact of our bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>But I am talking of really discovering this: really finding out by experience that it is true.</p>
                <p>Thus, in one sense, the road back to God is a road of moral effort, of trying harder and harder. But in another sense it is not trying that is ever going to bring us home. All this trying leads up to the vital moment at which you turn to God and say, 'You must do this. I can't.' Do not, I implore you, start asking yourselves, 'Have I reached that moment?'</p>
                <p>A man does not always say to himself, 'Hullo! I'm growing up.' It is often only when he looks back that he realises what has happened and recognises it as what people call 'growing up'.</p>
                <p>It is he change from being confident about our own efforts to the state in which we despair of doing anything for ourselves and leave it to God.</p>
                <p>The sense in which a Christian leaves it to God is that he puts all his trust in CHrist: trusts that Christ will somehow share with him the perfect human obedience which He carried out from His birth to His crucifixion: that Christ will make the man more like Himself and, in a sense, make good his deficiencies.</p>
                <p>But the difficulty is to reach the point of recognising that all we have done and can do is nothing.</p>
                <p>To trust Him means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.</p>
                <p>Christian home is good actions, or Faith in Christ. I have no right really to speak on such a difficult question, but it does seem to me like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary.</p>
                <p>There are two parodies of the truth which different sets of Christians have, in the past, been accused by other Christians of believing: perhaps they may make the truth clearer. One set were accused of saying, 'Good actions are all that matters. The best good action is charity. The best kind of charity is giving money. The best thing to give money to is the Church. So hand us over $10,000 and we will see you through.' The answer to that nonsense, of course, would be that good actions done for that motive, done with the idea that Heaven can be bought, would not be good actions at all, but only commercial speculations. The other set were accused of saying, 'Faith is all that matters. Consequently, if you have faith, it doesn't matter what you do. Sin away, my lad, and have a good time and Christ will see that it makes no difference in the end.' The answer to that nonsense is that, if what you call your 'faith' in Christ does not involve taking the slightest notice of what He says, then it is not Faith at all - not faith or trust in Him, but only intellectual acceptance of some theory about Him.</p>

                <h1>Making and Begetting</h1>
                <p>The map is admittedly only coloured paper, but there are two things you have to remember about it. In the first place, it is based on what hundreds and thousands of people have found out by sailing the real Atlantic. In that way it has behind it masses of experience just as real as the one you could have from the beach; only, while yours would be a single glimpse, the map fits all those different experiences together. In the second place, if you want to go anywhere, the map is absolutely necessary. As long as you are content with walks on the beach, your own glimpses are far more fun than looking at a map. But the map is going to be n=more use than walks on the beach if you want to get to America.</p>
                <p>Doctrines are not God: they are only a kind of map.</p>
                <p>It is quite true that if we took Christ's advice we should soon be living in a happier world. You need not even go as far as Christ. If we did all that Plato or Aristotle or Confucius told us, we should get on a great deal better than we do. And so what? We never have gollowed the advice of the great teachers. Why are we likely to begin now? Why are we more likely to follow Christ than any of the others? Because He is the best moral teacher? But that makes it even less likely that we shall follow Him. If we cannot take the elementary lessons, is it likely we are going to take the most advanced one? If Christianity only means one more bit of good advice, then Christianity is of no importance. There has been no lack of good advice for the last four thousand years. A bit more makes no difference</p>
                <p>There is no good complaining that these statements are difficult. Christianity claims to be telling us about another world, about something behind the world we can touch and hear and see. You may think the claim false, but if it were true, what it tells us would be bound to be difficult - at least as difficult as modern Physics, and for the same reason.</p>
                <p>That is why men are not Sons of God in the sense that Christ is. They may be like God in certain ways, but they are not things of the same kind. They are more like statues or pictures of God.</p>

                <h1>The Three-Personal God</h1>
                <p>The last chapter was about the difference between begetting and making. A man begets a child, but he only makes a statue. God begets Christ but He only makes men.</p>
                <p>When you come to knowing God, the initiative lies on His side. If He does not show Himself, nothing you can do will enable you to find Him. And, in fact, He shows much more of Himself to some people than to others - not because He has favourites, but because it is impossible for Him to show Himself to a man whose whole mind and character are in the wrong condition.</p>
                <p>If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. But it is not. We cannot compete, in simplicity, with people who are inventing religions. How could we? We are dealing with Fact. Of course anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about.</p>

                <h2>3</h2>
                <h1>Time and Beyond Time</h1>
                <p>It is a very silly idea that in reading a book you must never 'skip'. All sensible people skip freely when they come to a chapter which they find is going to be no use to them. In this chapter I am going to talk about something which may be helpful to some readers, but which may seem to others merely an unnecessary complication. If you are one of the second sort of readers, then I advise you not to bother about this chapter at all but to turn on to the next.</p>
                <p>A man put it to me by saying 'I can believe in God all right, but what I cannot swallow is the idea of Him attending to several hundred million human beings who are all addressing Him at the same moment.' And I have found that quite a lot of people feel this.</p>
                <p>Well that is of course what happends to us. Our life comes to us moment by moment. One moment disappears before the next comes along: and there is room for very little in each. That is what Time is like.</p>
                <p>We tend to assume that the whole universe and God Himself are always moving on from past to future just as we do. But many learned men do not agree with that. It was the Theologians who first started the idea that some things are not in Time at all: later the Philosophers took it over: and now some of the scientists are doing the same.</p>
                <p>Almost certainly God is not in Time.</p>
                <p>Let me try to give something, not the same, but a bit like it. Suppose I am writing a novel. I write 'Mary laid down her work; next moment came a knock at the door!' For Mary who has to live in the imaginary time of my story there is no interval between putting down the work and hearing the knock. But I, who am Mary's maker, do not live in that imaginary time at all. Between writing the first half of that sentence and the second, I might sit down for three hours and think steadily about Mary. I could think about Mary as if she were the only character in the book and for as long as I pleased, and the hours I spent in doing so would not appear in Mary's time (the time inside the story) at all.</p>
                <p>This is not a perfect illustration, of course. But it may give just a glimpse of what I believe to be the truth.</p>
                <p>He does not have to deal with us in the mass. You are as much alone with Him as if you were the only being He had ever created. When Christ died, He died for you individually just as much as if you had been the only man in the world.</p>
                <p>Everyone who believes in God at all believes that He knows what you and I are going to do tomorrow. But if He knows I am going to do so-and-so, how can I be free to do otherwise? Well, here once again, the difficulty come from thinking that God is progressing along the Time-line like us: the only difference being that He can see ahead and we can-not.</p>
                <p>All the days are 'Now' for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday; He simply sees you doing them, because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not.</p>
                <p>You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way - because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already 'Now' for Him.</p>
                <p>This idea has helped me a good deal. If it does not help you, leave it alone. It is a 'Christian idea' in the sense that great and wise CHristians have held it and there is nothing in it contrary to Christianity.</p>
                <p>You can be a perfectly good Christian without accepting it, or indeed without thinking of the matter at all.</p>

                <h2>4</h2>
                <h1>Good Infection</h1>
                <p>I said a few pages back that God is a Being which contains three Persons while remaining one Being, just as a cube contains six squares while remaining one body.</p>
                <p>The First Person is called the Father and the Second the Son.</p>
                <p>The Son exists because the Father exists: but there never was a time before the Father produced the Son.</p>
                <p>And that, by the way, is perhaps the most important difference between Christianity and all other religions: that in Christianity God is not a static thing - not even a person - but a dynamic, pulsating activity, a life, almost a kind of drama.</p>
                <p>What grows out of the joint life of the Father and Son is a real Person, is in fact the Third of three Persons who are God.</p>
                <p>This third Person is called, in technical language, the Holy Ghost or the 'spirit' of God.</p>
                <p>If you think of the Father as something 'out there', in front of you, and of the Son as someone standing at your sid, helping you to pray, trying to turn you into another son, then you have to think of the third Person as something inside you, or behind you.</p>
                <p>And now, what does it all matter? It matters more than anything else in the world. The whole dance, or drama, or pattern of this three-Personal life is to be played out in each one of us: or (putting it the other way round) each one of us has got to enter that pettern, take his place in that dance.</p>
                <p>You remember what I said in Chapter I about <em>begetting</em> and <em>making</em>. We are not begotten by God, we are only made by Him: in our natural state we are not sons of God, only (so to speak) statues. We have not got <em>Zoe</em> or spiritual life: only <em>Bios</em> or biological life which is presently going to rund down and die. Now the whole offer which CHristianity makes is this: that we can, if we let God have His way, come to share in the life of Christ. If we do, we shall then be sharing a life which was begotten, not made, which always has existed and always will exist.</p>
                <p>He came to this world and became a man in order to spread to other men the kind of life He has - by what I call 'good infection'. Every CHristian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simplly nothing else.</p>

                <h2>5</h2>
                <h1>The Obstinate Toy Soldiers</h1>
                <p>The Second Person in God, the Son, became human Himself: was born into the world as an actual man - a real man of a particular height, with hair of a particular colour, speaking a particular language, weighing so many stone.</p>
                <p>The result of this was that you now had one man who really was what all men were intended to be: one man in whom the created life, derived from His Mother, allowed itself to be completely and perfectly turned into the begotten life. The natural human creature in Him was taken up fully into the divine Son. Thus in one instance humanity had, so to speak, arrived: had passed into the life of Christ.</p>
                <p>And then, after bing thus killed - killed every day in a sense - the human creature in Him, because it was united to the divine Son, came to life again. The Man in Christ rose again: not only the God. That is the whole point. For the first time we saw a real man. One tin soldier - real tin, just like the rest - had come fully and splendidly alive.</p>
                <p>What, the, is the difference which He has made to the whole human mass? It is just this; that the business of becoming a son of God, of being turned from a created thing into a begotten thing, of passing over from the temporary biological life into timeless 'spiritual' life, has been done for us. Humanity is already 'saved' in principle. We individuals have to appropriate that salvation. But the really tough work - the bit we could not have done for ourselves - has been done for us.</p>
                <p>Remember what I said about 'good infection'. One of our own race has this new life: if we get close to Him we shall catch it from Him.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>6</h2>
                <h1>Two Notes</h1>
                <p>(1) One sensible critic wrote asking me why, if God wanted sons instead of 'toy soldiers', He did not <em>beget</em> many sons at the outset instead of first <em>making</em> toy soldiers and then bringing them to life by such a difficult and painful process. One part of the answer to this question is fairly easy: the other part is probably beyond all human knowledge. The easy part is this. The process of being turned from a creature into a son would not have been difficult or painful if the human race had not turned away from God centuries ago. They were able to do this because He gave them free will: He gave them free will because a world of mere automata could never love and therefore never know infinite happiness. The difficult part is this. All Christians are ageed that there is, in the full and original sense, only one 'Son of God'. If we insist on asking 'But could there have been many?' we find ourselves in very deep water. Have thewords 'Could have been' any sense at all when applied to God?</p>
                <p>(2) The idea that the whole human race is, in a sense, one thing - one huge organism, like a tree - must not be foncused with the idea that individual differences do not matter or that real people, Tom and Nobby and Kate, are somehow less important than collective things like classes, races, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Six pennies are quite separate and very alike: my nose and my lungs are very different but they are only alive at all because they are parts of my body and share its common life. Christianity thinkgs of human individuals not as mere members of a group or items in a list, but as organs in a body - different from one another and each contributing what no other could.</p>
                <p>If you forget that he belongs to the same organism as yourself you will become an Individualist. If you forget that he is a different organ from you, if you want to suppress differences and make people all alike, you will become a Totalitarian. But a Christian must not be either a Totalitarian or an Individualist.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>7</h2>
                <h1>Let's Pretend</h1>
                <p>Its very first words are <em>Our Father</em>...They mean quite frankly, that you are putting yourself in the place of a son of God. To put it bluntly, you are <em>dressing up as Christ.</em> If you like, you are pretending.</p>
                <p>But the odd thing is that He has ordered us to do it.</p>
                <p>Very often the only way to get a quality in reality is to start behaving as if you had it already.</p>
                <p>The real Son of God is at your side. He is beginning to turn you into the same kind of thing as Himself.</p>
                <p>If there were no help from Christ, there would be no help from other human beings. He works on us in all sorts of ways: not only through what we think our 'religious life'. He works through Nature, through our own bodies, through books, sometimes through experiences which seem (at the time) <em>anti</em>-Christian.</p>
                <p>But above all, He works on us through each other.</p>
                <p>That is why the Church, the whole body of Christians showing Him to one another, is so important.</p>
                <p>Bud do not forget this. At first it is natural for a baby to take its mother's milk withough knowing its mother. It is equally natural for us to see the man who helps us without seeing Christ behind him. But we must not remain babies. We must go on to recognise the real Giver.</p>
                <p>And now we begin to see what it is that the New Testament is alwyas talking about. It talks about Christians 'being born again'; it talks about them 'putting on Christ'; about Christ 'being formed in us'; about our coming to 'have the mind Christ'.</p>
                <p>It is not a question of a good man who died two thousand years ago. It is a living Man, still as much a man as you, and still as much God as He was when He created the world, really coming and interfering with your very self; killing the old natural self in you and replacing it with the kind of self He has. At first only for moments. Then for longer periods. Finally, if all goes well, turning you permanently into a different sort of thing; into a new little Christ, a being which, in its own small way, has the same kind of life as God; which shares in His power, joy, knowledge and eternity.</p>
                <p>When I come to my evening prayers and try to reckon up the sins of the day, nine times out of ten the most obvious one is some sin against charity; I have sulked or snapped or sneered or snubbed or stormed. And the excuse that immediately springs to my mind is that the provocation was so sudden and unexpected; I was caught off my guard, I had not time to collect myself. Now that may be an extenuating circumstance as regards those particular acts: they would obviously be worse if they had been deliberate and premeditated. On the other hand, surely what a man does when he is taken off his guard is the best evidence for what sort of a man he is? Surely what pops out before the man has time to put on a disguise is the truth?</p>
                <p>And if (as I said before) what we are matters even more than what we do - if, indeed, what we do matters chiefly as evidence of what we are - then it follows that the change which I most need to undergo is a change that my own direct, voluntary efforts cannot bring about. And this applies to my good actions too. How many of them were done for the right motive? How many for fear of public opinion, or a desire to show off?</p>
                <p>But I cannot, by direct moral effort, give myself new motives. After the first few steps in the Christian life we realise that everything which really needs to be done in our souls can be done only by God. And tha brings us to something which has been very misleading in my language up to now.</p>
                <p>I have been talking as if it were we who did everything. In reality, of course, it is God who does everything. We, at most, allow it to be done to us.</p>
                <p>God looks at you as if you were a little Christ: Christ stands beside you to turn you into one. I dare say this idea of a divine make-believe sounds rather strange at first. But, is it so strange really? Is not that how the higher thing always raises the lower? A mother teaches her baby to talk by talking to it as if it understood long before it really does. We treat our dogs as if they were 'almost human': that is why they really become 'almost human' in the end.</p>

                <h1>Is Christianity Hard or Easy?</h1>
                <p>The more you obey your conscience, the more your conscience will demand of you.</p>
                <p>The Christian way is different: harder, and easier. Christ says 'Give me All. I don't want so much of your time ans so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You. I have not come to torment your natural self, but to kill it...</p>
                <p>...I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours.'</p>
                <p>You have noticed, I expect, that Christ Himself sometimes describes the Christian way as very hard, sometimes as very easy.</p>
                <p>The cowardly thing is also the most dangerous thing.</p>
                <p>We are all trying to let our mind and heart go their own way - centered on money or pleasure or ambition - and hoping, in spite of this, to behave honestly and chastely and humbly. And that is exactly what Christ warned us you could not do.</p>
                <p>That is why the real problem of the Christian life comes where people do not usually look for it. It comes the very moment you wake up each morning. All your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists simply in shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in. And so on, all day. Standing back from all your natural fussings and frettings; coming in out of the wind.</p>
                <p>We can only do it for moments at first. But from those moments the new sort of life will be spreading through our system: because now we are letting Him work at the right part of us.</p>
                <p>It says in the Bible that the whole universe was made for Christ and that everything is to be gathered together in Him.</p>

                <h1>Counting The Cost</h1>
                <p>On the one hand, God's demand for perfection need not discourage you in the least in your present attempts to be good, or even in your present failures. Each time you fall He will pick you up again. And He knows perfectly well that your own efforts are never going to bring you anywhere near perfection. On the other hand, you must realise from the outset that the goal towards which He is beginning to guide you is absolute perfection; and no power in the whole universe, except you yourself, can prevent Him from taking you to that goal.</p>
                <p>Of course we never wanted, and never asked, to be made into the sort of creatures He is going to make us into. But the question is not what we intended ourselves to be, but what He intended us to be when He made us. He is the inventor, we are only the machine.</p>
                <p>The command <em>Be ye perfect</em> is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command. He said (in the Bible) that we were 'gods' and He is going to make good His words. If we let Him - for we can prevent Him, if we choose - He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess...</p>

                <p>He meant what He said. Those who put themselves in His hands will become perfect, as He is perfect - perfect in love, wisdom, joy, beauty, and immortality. The change will not be completed in this life, for death is an important part of the treatment.</p>
                <p>Fine feelings, new insights, greater interest in 'religion' mean nothing unless they make our actual behaviour better; just as in an illness 'feeling better' is not much good if the thermometer shows that your temperature is still going up.</p>
                <p>When we Christians behave badly, or fail to behave well, we are making Christianity unbelievable to the outside world.</p>
                <p>Will they, or will they not, turn to Him and thus fulfil the only purpose for which they were created? Their free will is trembling inside them like the needle of a compass. But this is a needle that can choose. It <em>can</em> point to its true North; but it need not. Will the needle swing round, and settle, and point to God?</p>
                <p>He can help it to do so. He cannot force it. He cannot, so to speak, put out His own hand and pull it into the right position, for then it would not be free will any more.</p>
                <p>One of the dangers of having a lot of money is that you may be quite satisfied with the kinds of happiness money can give and so fail to realise your need for God.</p>
                <p>(Some of the last will be first and some of the first will be last).</p>
                <p>For mere improvement is not redemption, though redemption always improves people even here and now and will, in the end, improve them to a degree we cannot yet imagine.</p>

                <h1>The New Men</h1>
                <p>Thousands of centuries ago hug, very heavily armoured creatures were evolved. If anyone had at that time been watching the course of Evolution he would probably have expected that it was going to go on to heavier and heavier armour. But he would have been wrong. The future had a card up its sleeve which nothing at that time would have led him to expect. It was going to spring on him little, naked, unarmoured animals which had better brains: and with those brains they were going to master the whole planet.</p>
                <p>Now, if you care to talk in these terms, the Christian view is precisely that the Next Step has already appeared. And it is really new. It is not a change from brainy men to brainier men: it is a change that goes off in a totally different direction - a change from being creatures of God to being sons of God. The first instance appeared in Palestine two thousand years ago. In a sense, the change is not 'Evolution' at all, because it is not something arising out of the natural process of events but something coming into nature from outside.</p>
                <p>The more we get what we now call 'ourselves' out of the way and let Him take us over, the more truly ourselves we become.</p>
                <p>It is no good trying to 'be myslef' without Him. The more I resist Him and try to live on my own, the more I become dominated by my own heredity and upbringing and surroundings and natural desires.</p>
                <p>What I call 'My wishes' become merely the desires thrown up by my physical organism or pumped into me by other men's thoughts or even suggested to me by devils. Eggs and alcohol and a good night's sleep will be the real origins of what I flatter myslef by regarding as my own highly personal and discriminating decision to make love to the girl opposite to me in the railway carriage. Propaganda will be the real origin of what I regard as my own personal political ideas. I am not, in my natural state, nearly so much of a person as I like to believe: most of what I call 'me' can be very easily explained. It is when I turn to Christ, when I give myself up to His Personality, that I first begin to have a real personality of my own.</p>
                <p>How monotonously alike all the great tyrants and conquerors have been: how gloriously different are the saints.</p>
                <p>But there must be a real giving up of the self. You must throw it away 'blindly' so to speak. Christ will indeed give you a real personality: but you must not go to Him for the sake of that.</p>
                <p>Your real, new self (which is Christ's and also yours, and yours just because it is His) will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him.</p>
